Make a index.html page containing a processing js sketch for a fullscreen splash page background that displays the text of hamlet in a soft muted tone, with fluctuating lighting behind each line that moves across the screen slowly.  The entire screen should be covered with letters and no empty space should be shown.  It should use a fancy font for the text, and use mocassin and brown and white.  Do not use a pde file.
