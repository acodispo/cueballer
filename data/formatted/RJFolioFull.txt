NS: Act 1 Scene 1

SD: Enter +SAMPSON and +GREGORY, with Swords and Bucklers, of the House of CAPULET.

+SAMPSON
GREGORY: A my word wee'l not carry coales.

+GREGORY
No, for then we should be Colliars.

+SAMPSON
I mean, if we be in choller, wee'l draw.

+GREGORY
I, While you liue, draw your necke out o'th Collar.

+SAMPSON
I strike quickly, being mou'd.

+GREGORY
But thou art not quickly mou'd to strike.

+SAMPSON
A dog of the house of MOUNTAGUE, moues me.

+GREGORY
To moue, is to stir: and to be valiant, is to stand:
Therefore, if thou art mou'd, thou runst away.

+SAMPSON
A dogge of that house shall moue me to stand.
I will take the wall of any Man or Maid of MOUNTAGUES.

+GREGORY
That shewes thee a weake slaue, for the weakest
goes to the wall.

+SAMPSON
True, and therefore women being the
weaker Vessels, are euer thrust to the wall: therefore I
will push MOUNTAGUES men from the wall, and thrust his
Maides to the wall.

+GREGORY
The Quarrell is betweene our Masters, and vs
their men.

+SAMPSON
'Tis all one, I will shew my selfe a tyrant: when
I haue fought with the men, I will bee ciuill with the
Maids, and cut off their heads.

+GREGORY
The heads of the Maids?

+SAMPSON
I, the heads of the Maids, or their Maiden-heads,
Take it in what sence thou wilt.

+GREGORY
They must take it sence, that feele it.

+SAMPSON
Me they shall feele while I am able to stand: And
'tis knowne I am a pretty peece of flesh.

+GREGORY
'Tis well thou art not Fish: If thou had'st, thou
had'st beene poore +JOHN. Draw thy Toole, here comes of
the House of the MOUNTAGUES.

SD: Enter two other Seruingmen.

+SAMPSON
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I wil back
thee

+GREGORY
How? Turne thy backe, and run.

+SAMPSON
Feare me not.

+GREGORY
No marry: I feare thee.

+SAMPSON
Let vs take the Law of our sides: let them
begin.

+GREGORY
I wil frown as I passe by, & let tháº½ take it as
they list

+SAMPSON
Nay, as they dare.
I wil bite my Thumb at them,
which is a disgrace to them, if they beare it.

+ABRAHAM
Do you bite your Thumbe at vs sir?

+SAMPSON
I do bite my Thumbe, sir.

+ABRAHAM
Do you bite your Thumb at vs, sir?

+SAMPSON
Is the Law of our side, if I say
I?

+GREGORY
No.

+SAMPSON
No sir, I do not bite my Thumbe at you sir: but
I bite my Thumbe sir.

+GREGORY
Do you quarrell sir?

+ABRAHAM
Quarrell sir? no sir.

+SAMPSON
If you do sir, I am for you, I serue as good
a man as you

+ABRAHAM
No better?

+SAMPSON
Well sir.

SD: Enter +BENUOLIO.

+GREGORY
Say better: here comes one
of my masters kinsmen.

+SAMPSON
Yes, better.

+ABRAHAM
You Lye.

+SAMPSON
Draw if you be men.
+GREGORY, remember thy
washing blow.

SD: They Fight.

+BENUOLIO
Part Fooles,
put vp your Swords, you know not what you do.

SD: Enter +TIBALT.

+TYBALT
What art thou drawne, among these heartlesse / Hindes?
Turne thee +BENUOLIO, looke vpon thy death.

+BENUOLIO
I do but keepe the peace, put vp thy Sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.

+TYBALT
What draw, and talke of peace? I hate the word
As I hate hell, all MOUNTAGUES, and thee:
Haue at thee Coward.

SD: Fight.

SD: Enter three or foure Citizens with Clubs.

+OFFICER
Clubs, Bils, and Partisons, strike, beat them
down / Downe with the CAPULETS, downe with the
MOUNTAGUES.

SD: Enter old +CAPULET in his Gowne, and his wife.

+CAPULET
What noise is this?
Giue me my long Sword ho.

+CAPULET'S WIFE
A crutch, a crutch: why call you for a Sword?

SD: Enter old +MOUNTAGUE, & his wife.

+CAPULET
My Sword I say: Old +MOUNTAGUE is come,
And flourishes his Blade in spight of me.

+MOUNTAGUE
Thou villaine +CAPULET.
Hold me not, let me go

+MOUNTAGUE'S WIFE
Thou shalt not stir a foote to seeke a Foe.

SD: Enter PRINCE +ESKALES, with his Traine.

+PRINCE ESKALES
Rebellious Subiects, Enemies to peace,
Prophaners of this Neighbor-stained Steele,
Will they not heare? What hoe, you Men, you Beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernitious Rage,
With purple Fountaines issuing from your Veines:
On paine of Torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper'd Weapons to the ground,
And heare the Sentence of your mooued Prince.
Three ciuill Broyles, bred of an Ayery word,
By thee old +CAPULET and +MOUNTAGUE,
Haue thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona's ancient Citizens
Cast by their Graue beseeming Ornaments,
To wield old Partizans, in hands as old,
Cankred with peace, to part your Cankred hate,
If euer you disturbe our streets againe,
Your liues shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time all the rest depart away:
You +CAPULET shall goe along with me,
And +MOUNTAGUE come you this afternoone,
To know our Fathers pleasure in this case:
To old Free-towne, our common iudgement place:
Once more on paine of death, all men depart.

SD: Exeunt ABRAHAM, +BENUOLIO, +CAPULET, +CAPULET'S WIFE, +GREGORY, +MOUNTAGUE, +MOUNTAGUE'S WIFE, OFFICER, PETER, +SAMPSON, +TIBALT.

+MOUNTAGUE
Who set this auncient quarrell new abroach?
Speake Nephew, were you by, when it began:

+BENUOLIO
Heere were the seruants of your aduersarie,
And yours close fighting ere I did approach,
I drew to part them, in the instant came
The fiery +TIBALT, with his sword prepar'd,
Which as he breath'd defiance to my eares,
He swong about his head, and cut the windes,
Who nothing hurt withall, hist him in scorne.
While we were enterchanging thrusts and blowes,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.

+MOUNTAGUE'S WIFE
O where is +ROMEO, saw you him to day?
Right glad am I, he was not at this fray.

+BENUOLIO
Madam, an houre before the worshipt Sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
A troubled mind draue me to walke abroad,
Where vnderneath the groue of Sycamour,
That West-ward rooteth from this City side:
So earely walking did I see your Sonne:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the couert of the wood,
I measuring his affections by my owne,
Which then most sought, wher most might not be found:
Being one too many by my weary selfe,
Pursued my Honour, not pursuing his
And gladly shunn'd, who gladly fled from me.

+MOUNTAGUE
Many a morning hath he there beene seene,
With teares augmenting the fresh mornings deaw,
Adding to cloudes, more cloudes with his deepe sighes,
But all so soone as the all-cheering Sunne,
Should in the farthest East begin to draw
The shadie Curtaines from Auroras bed,
Away from light steales home my heauy Sonne,
And priuate in his Chamber pennes himselfe,
Shuts vp his windowes, lockes faire day-light out,
And makes himselfe an artificiall night:
Blacke and portendous must this humour proue,
Vnlesse good counsell may the cause remoue.

+BENUOLIO
My Noble Vncle doe you know the cause?

+MOUNTAGUE
I neither know it, nor can learne of him.

+BENUOLIO
Haue you importun'd him by any meanes?

+MOUNTAGUE
Both by my selfe and many others Friends,
But he his owne affections counseller,
Is to himselfe [I will not say how true]
But to himselfe so secret and so close,
So farre from sounding and discouery,
As is the bud bit with an enuious worme,
Ere he can spread his sweete leaues to the ayre,
Or dedicate his beauty to the same.
Could we but learne from whence his sorrowes grow,
We would as willingly giue cure, as know.

SD: Enter +ROMEO.

+BENUOLIO
See where he comes, so please you step aside,
Ile know his greeuance, or be much denide.

+MOUNTAGUE
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
To heare true shrift.
Come Madam let's away.

SD: Exeunt +MOUNTAGUE, +MOUNTAGUE'S WIFE.

+BENUOLIO
Good morrow Cousin.

+ROMEO
Is the day so young?

+BENUOLIO
But new strooke nine.

+ROMEO
Aye me, sad houres seeme long:
Was that my Father that went hence so fast?

+BENUOLIO
It was: what sadnes lengthens +ROMEO's houres?

+ROMEO
Not hauing that, which hauing, makes them short

+BENUOLIO
In loue.

+ROMEO
Out.

+BENUOLIO
Of loue.

+ROMEO
Out of her fauour where I am in loue.

+BENUOLIO
Alas that loue so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proofe.

+ROMEO
Alas that loue, whose view is muffled still,
Should without eyes, see path-wayes to his will:
Where shall we dine? O me: what fray was heere?
Yet tell me not, for I haue heard it all:
Heere's much to do with hate, but more with loue:
Why then, O brawling loue, O louing hate,
O any thing, of nothing first created:
O heauie lightnesse, serious vanity,
Mishapen Chaos of welseeing formes,
Feather of lead, bright smoake, cold fire, sicke health,
Still waking sleepe, that is not what it is:
This loue feele I, that feele no loue in this.
Doest thou not laugh?

+BENUOLIO
No Coze, I rather weepe.

+ROMEO
Good heart, at what?

+BENUOLIO
At thy good hearts oppression.

+ROMEO
Why such is loues transgression.
Griefes of mine owne lie heauie in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to haue it preast
With more of thine, this loue that thou hast showne,
Doth adde more griefe, to too much of mine owne.
Loue, is a smoake made with the fume of sighes,
Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in Louers eyes,
Being vext, a Sea nourisht with louing teares,
What is it else? a madnesse, most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preseruing sweet:
Farewell my Coze.

+BENUOLIO
Soft I will goe along.
And if you leaue me so, you do me wrong.

+ROMEO
Tut I haue lost my selfe, I am not here,
This is not +ROMEO, hee's some other where.

+BENUOLIO
Tell me in sadnesse, who is that you loue?

+ROMEO
What shall I grone and tell thee?

+BENUOLIO
Grone, why no:
but sadly tell me who.

+ROMEO
A sicke man in sadnesse makes his will:
A word ill vrg'd to one that is so ill:
In sadnesse Cozin, I do loue a woman.

+BENUOLIO
I aym'd so neare, when I suppos'd you lou'd.

+ROMEO
A right good marke man, and shee's faire I loue

+BENUOLIO
A right faire marke, faire Coze, is soonest hit.

+ROMEO
Well in that hit you misse, sheel not be hit
With Cupids arrow, she hath +DIANS wit:
And in strong proofe of chastity well arm'd:
From loues weake childish Bow, she liues vncharm'd.
Shee will not stay the siege of louing tearmes,
Nor bid th'incounter of assailing eyes.
Nor open her lap to Sainct-seducing Gold:
O she is rich in beautie, onely poore,
That when she dies, with beautie dies her store.

+BENUOLIO
Then she hath sworne, that she will still liue chast?

+ROMEO
She hath, and in that sparing make huge wast?
For beauty steru'd with her seuerity,
Cuts beauty off from all posteritie.
She is too faire, too wisewi: sely too faire,
To merit blisse by making me dispaire:
She hath forsworne to loue, and in that vow
Do I liue dead, that liue to tell it now.

+BENUOLIO
Be rul'd by me, forget to thinke of her.

+ROMEO
O teach me how I should forget to thinke.

+BENUOLIO
By giuing liberty vnto thine eyes,
Examine other beauties,

+ROMEO
'Tis the way
to cal hers [exquisit] in question more,
These happy maskes that kisse faire Ladies browes,
Being blacke, puts vs in mind they hide the faire:
He that is strooken blind, cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eye-sight lost:
Shew me a Mistresse that is passing faire,
What doth her beauty serue but as a note,
Where I may read who past that passing faire.
Farewell thou can'st not teach me to forget,

+BENUOLIO
Ile pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

SD: Exeunt +BENUOLIO, +ROMEO.
NS: Act 1 Scene 2

SD: Enter +CAPULET, Countie +PARIS, and the Clowne.

+CAPULET
+MOUNTAGUE is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike, and 'tis not hard I thinke,
For men so old as wee, to keepe the peace.

+PARIS
Of Honourable reckoning are you both,
And pittie 'tis you liu'd at ods so long:
But now my Lord, what say you to my sute?

+CAPULET
But saying ore what I haue said before,
My Child is yet a stranger in the world,
Shee hath not seene the change of fourteene yeares,
Let two more Summers wither in their pride,
Ere we may thinke her ripe to be a Bride.

+PARIS
Younger then she, are happy mothers made.

+CAPULET
And too soone mar'd are those so early made:
Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,
Shee's the hopefull Lady of my earth:
But wooe her gentle +PARIS, get her heart,
My will to her consent, is but a part,
And shee agree, within her scope of choise,
Lyes my consent, and faire according voice:
This night I hold an old accustom'd Feast,
Whereto I haue inuited many a Guest,
Such as I loue, and you among the store,
One more, most welcome makes my number more:
At my poore house, looke to behold this night,
Earth-treading starres, that make darke heauen light,
Such comfort as do lusty young men feele,
When well apparrel'd Aprill on the heele
Of limping Winter treads, euen such delight
Among fresh Fennell buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house: heare all, all see:
And like her most, whose merit most shall be:
Which one more veiw, of many, mine being one,
May stand in number, though in reckning none.
Come, goe with me: goe sirrah trudge about,
Through faire Verona, find those persons out,
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My house and welcome, on their pleasure stay.

SD: CAPULET exits.

+SERVANT
Find them out whose names are written.
Heere it is written, that the Shoo-maker should meddle with his Yard, and the Tayler with his Last, the Fisher with his Pensill, and the Painter with his Nets.
But I am sent to find those persons whose names are writ, & can neuer find what names the writing person hath here writ [I must to the learned] in good time.

SD: Enter +BENUOLIO, and +ROMEO.

+BENUOLIO
Tut man, one fire burnes out anothers burning,
One paine is lesned by anothers anguish:
Turne giddie, and be holpe by backward turning:
One desparate greefe, cures with anothers lauguish:
Take thou some new infection to the eye,
And the rank poyson of the old wil die.

+ROMEO
Your Plantan leafe is excellent for that.

+BENUOLIO
For what I pray thee?

+ROMEO
For your broken shin.

+BENUOLIO
Why +ROMEO art thou mad?

+ROMEO
Not mad, but bound more then a mad man is:
Shut vp in prison, kept without my foode,
Whipt and tormented: and Godden good fellow,

+SERVANT
Godgigoden, I pray sir can you read?

+ROMEO
I mine owne fortune in my miserie.

+SERVANT
Perhaps you haue learn'd it without booke:
But I pray can you read any thing you see?

+ROMEO
I, if I know the Letters and the Language.

+SERVANT
Ye say honestly, rest you merry.

+ROMEO
Stay fellow, I can read.

SD: He reades the Letter.

+ROMEO
SEigneur Martino, and his wife and daughter: County +ANSELME and his beautious sisters: the Lady widdow of +VTRUUIO, Seigneur Placentio, and his louely Neeces: +MERCUTIO and his brother +VALENTINE: mine vncle +CAPULET his wife and daughters: my faire Neece +ROSALINE, +LIUIA, Seigneur +VALENTIO, & his Cosen +TYBALT: +LUCIO and the liuely +HELENA.
A faire assembly, whither should they come?

+SERVANT
Vp.

+ROMEO
Whither? to supper?

+SERVANT
To our house.

+ROMEO
Whose house?

+SERVANT
My Maisters.

+ROMEO
Indeed I should haue askt you that before.

+SERVANT
Now Ile tell you without asking.
My maister is the great rich +CAPULET, and if you be not of the house of +MOUNTAGUES I pray come and crush a cup of wine.
Rest you merry.

SD: SERVANT exits.

+BENUOLIO
At this same auncient Feast of +CAPULETS
Sups the faire +ROSALINE, whom thou so loues:
With all the admired Beauties of Verona,
Go thither and with vnattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee thinke thy Swan a Crow.

+ROMEO
When the deuout religion of mine eye
Maintaines such falshood, then turne teares to fire:
And these who often drown'd could neuer die,
Transparent Heretiques be burnt for liers.
One fairer then my loue: the all-seeing Sun
Nere saw her match, since first the world begun.

+BENUOLIO
Tut, you saw her faire, none else being by,
Herselfe poys'd with herselfe in either eye:
But in that Christall scales, let there be waid,
Your Ladies loue against some other Maid
That I will show you, shining at this Feast,
And she shew scant shell, well, that now shewes best.

+ROMEO
Ile goe along, no such sight to be showne,
But to reioyce in splendor of mine owne.
NS: Act 1 Scene 3

SD: Enter CAPULETS Wife and Nurse.

+CAPULET'S WIFE
Nurse wher's my daughter?
call her forth to me.

+NURSE
Now by my Maidenhead, at twelue yeare old
I bad her come, what Lamb: what Ladi-bird,
God forbid, / Where's this Girle? what +IULIET?

SD: Enter +IULIET.

+IULIET
How now, who calls?

+NURSE
Your Mother.

+IULIET
Madam I am heere, what is your will?

+CAPULET'S WIFE
This is the matter: Nurse giue leaue awhile,
we must talke in secret.
Nurse come backe againe,
I haue remembred me, thou'se heare our counsell.
Thou knowest my daughter's of a prety age.

+NURSE
Faith I can tell her age vnto an houre.

+CAPULET'S WIFE
Shee's not fourteene.

+NURSE
Ile lay fourteene of my teeth,
And yet to my teene be it spoken, / I haue but foure,
shee's not fourteene. / How long is it now
to +LAMMAS tide?

+CAPULET'S WIFE
A fortnight and odde dayes.

+NURSE
Euen or odde, of all daies in the yeare
come +LAMMAS Eue at night shall she be fourteene.
+SUSAN & she, God rest all Christian soules,
were of an age.
Well +SUSAN is with God,
she was too good for me.
But as I said,
on +LAMAS Eue at night shall she be fourteene,
that shall she marie, I remember it well.
'Tis since the Earth-quake now eleuen yeares,
and she was wean'd I neuer shall forget it,
of all the daies of the yeare, vpon that day:
for I had then laid Worme-wood to my Dug
sitting in the Sunne vnder the Douehouse wall,
my Lord and you were then at Mantua,
nay I doe beare a braine.
But as I said,
when it did tast the Worme-wood on the nipple
of my Dugge, and felt it bitter, pretty foole,
to see it teachie, and fall out with the Dugge,
Shake quoth the Doue-house, 'twas no neede I trow
to bid mee trudge:
and since that time it is a eleuen yeares,
for then she could stand alone, nay bi'th' roode
she could haue runne, & wadled all about:
for euen the day before she broke her brow,
& then my Husband God be with his soule,
a was a merrie man, tooke vp the Child,
yea quoth hee, doest thou fall vpon thy face?
thou wilt fall backeward when thou hast more wit,
wilt thou not +IULE?
And by my holy-dam,
the pretty wretch lefte crying, & said I:
to see now how a Iest shall come about.
I warrant, & I shall liue a thousand yeares,
I neuer should forget it: wilt thou not +IULET quoth he?
and pretty foole it stinted, and said I.

+CAPULET'S WIFE
Inough of this, I pray thee hold thy peace.

+NURSE
Yes Madam, yet I cannot chuse but laugh,
to thinke it should leaue crying, & say I:
and yet I warrant it had vpon it brow,
a bumpe as big as a young Cockrels stone?
A perilous knock, and it cryed bitterly.
Yea quoth my husband, fall'st vpon thy face,
thou wilt fall backward when thou commest to age:
wilt thou not +IULE? It stinted: and said I.

+IULIET
And stint thou too, I pray thee Nurse, say I.

+NURSE
Peace I haue done: God marke thee too his grace
thou wast the prettiest Babe that ere I nurst,
and I might liue to see thee married once,
I haue my wish.

+CAPULET'S WIFE
Marry that marry is the very theame
I came to talke of, tell me daughter +IULIET,
How stands your disposition to be Married?

+IULIET
It is an houre that I dreame not of.

+NURSE
An houre, were not I thine onely Nurse,
I would say thou had'st suckt wisedome from thy teat.

+CAPULET'S WIFE
Well thinke of marriage now, yonger then you
Heere in Verona, Ladies of esteeme,
Are made already Mothers.
By my count
I was your Mother, much vpon these yeares
That you are now a Maide, thus then in briefe:
The valiant +PARIS seekes you for his loue.

+NURSE
A man young Lady, Lady, such a man
as all the world.
Why hee's a man of waxe.

+CAPULET'S WIFE
Veronas Summer hath not such a flower.

+NURSE
Nay hee's a flower, infaith a very flower.

+CAPULET'S WIFE
What say you, can you loue the Gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our Feast,
Read ore the volume of young +PARIS face,
And find delight, writ there with Beauties pen:
Examine euery seuerall liniament,
And see how one another lends content:
And what obscur'd in this faire volume lies,
Find written in the Margent of his eyes.
This precious Booke of Loue, this vnbound Louer,
To Beautifie him, onely lacks a Couer.
The fish liues in the Sea, and 'tis much pride
For faire without, the faire within to hide:
That Booke in manies eyes doth share the glorie,
That in Gold claspes, Lockes in the Golden storie:
So shall you share all that he doth possesse,
By hauing him, making your selfe no lesse.

+NURSE
No lesse, nay bigger: women grow by men.

+CAPULET'S WIFE
Speake briefly, can you like of +PARIS loue?

+IULIET
Ile looke to like, if looking liking moue.
But no more deepe will I endart mine eye,
Then your consent giues strength to make flye.

SD: Enter a Seruing man.

+SERVANT

NS: Act 1 Scene 4

SD: Enter +ROMEO, +MERCUTIO, +BENUOLIO, with fiue or sixe other Maskers, Torch-bearers.

+ROMEO
What shall this speeh be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without Apologie?

+BENUOLIO
The date is out of such prolixitie,
Weele haue no +CUPID, hood winkt with a skarfe,
Bearing a Tartars painted Bow of lath,
Skaring the Ladies like a Crow-keeper.
But let them measure vs by what they will,
Weele measure them a Measure, and be gone.

+ROMEO
Giue me a Torch, I am not for this ambling.
Being but heauy I will beare the light.

+MERCUTIO
Nay gentle +ROMEO, we must haue you dance.

+ROMEO
Not I beleeue me, you haue dancing shooes
With nimble soles, I haue a soale of Lead
So stakes me to the ground, I cannot moue.

+MERCUTIO
You are a Louer, borrow Cupids wings,
And soare with them aboue a common bound.

+ROMEO
I am too sore enpearced with his shaft,
To soare with his light feathers, and to bound:
I cannot bound a pitch aboue dull woe,
Vnder loues heauy burthen doe I sinke.

+HORATIO
And to sinke in it should you burthen loue,
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

+ROMEO
Is loue a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rude, too boysterous, and it pricks like thorne.

+MERCUTIO
If loue be rough with you, be rough with loue,
Pricke loue for pricking, and you beat loue downe,
Giue me a Case to put my visage in,
A Visor for a Visor, what care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities:
Here are the Beetle-browes shall blush for me.

+BENUOLIO
Come knocke and enter, and no sooner in,
But euery man betake him to his legs.

+ROMEO
A Torch for me, let wantons light of heart
Tickle the sencelesse rushes with their heeles:
For I am prouerb'd with a Grandsier Phrase,
Ile be a Candle-holder and looke on,
The game was nere so faire, and I am done.

+MERCUTIO
Tut, duns the Mouse, the Constables owne word,
If thou art dun, weele draw thee from the mire.
Or saue your reuerence loue, wherein thou stickest
Vp to the eares, come we burne day-light ho.

+ROMEO
Nay that's not so.

+MERCUTIO
I meane sir I delay,
We wast our lights in vaine, lights, lights, by day;
Take our good meaning, for our Iudgement sits
Fiue times in that, ere once in our fine wits.

+ROMEO
And we meane well in going to this Maske,
But 'tis no wit to go.

+MERCUTIO
Why may one aske?

+ROMEO
I dreampt a dreame to night.

+MERCUTIO
And so did I.

+ROMEO
Well what was yours?

+MERCUTIO
That dreamers often lye.

+ROMEO
In bed a sleepe while they do dreame things true.

+MERCUTIO
O then I see Queene +MAB hath beene with you:
She is the Fairies Midwife, & she comes
in shape no bigger then Agat-stone,
on the fore-finger of an Alderman,
drawne with a teeme of little Atomies,
ouer mens noses as they lie asleepe:
Her Chariot is an emptie Haselnut,
made by the Ioyner Squirrel or old Grub,
time out a mind, the Faries Coach-makers:
her Waggon Spokes made of long Spinners legs:
the Couer of the wings of Grashoppers,
her Traces of the smallest Spiders web,
her coullers of the Moonshines watry Beames,
her Whip of Crickets bone, the Lash of Philome,
her Waggoner, a small gray-coated Gnat,
not halfe so bigge as a round little Worme,
prickt from the Lazie-finger of a man.
& in this state she gallops night by night,
through Louers braines: and then they dreame of Loue.
On Courtiers knees, that dreame on Cursies strait:
ore Lawyers fingers, who strait dreamt on Fees,
ore Ladies lips, who strait on kisses dreame,
which oft the angry +MAB with blisters plagues,
because their breath with Sweet meats tainted are.
Sometime she gallops ore a Courtiers nose,
& then dreames he of smelling out a sute:
& somtime comes she with Tith pigs tale,
tickling a Parsons nose as a lies asleepe,
then he dreames of another Benefice.
Sometime she driueth ore a Souldiers necke,
& then dreames he of cutting Forraine throats,
of Breaches, Ambuscados, Spanish Blades:
Of Healths fiue Fadome deepe, and then anon
drums in his eares, at which he startes and wakes;
and being thus frighted, sweares a prayer or two
& sleepes againe: this is that very +MAB
that plats the manes of Horses in the night:
& bakes the Elk-locks in foule sluttish haires,
which once vntangled, much misfortune bodes,
This is the hag, when Maides lie on their backs,
That presses them, and learnes them first to beare,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she.

+ROMEO
Peace, peace, +MERCUTIO peace,
Thou talk'st of nothing.
