NS: Act 1 Scene 2

SL: A battlefield.

SD: Alarum within. Enter King Malcolm, Donalbain, Lenox, with attendants, meeting a bleeding Captain.

KING
What bloody man is that? he can report,
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
The newest state.

MALCOLM
This is the Sergeant,
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
'Gainst my captivity: Hail brave friend;
Say to the King the knowledge of the broil,
As thou didst leave it.

CAPTAIN
Doubtful it stood,
As two spent swimmers that do cling together,
And choke their art: The merciless Macdonwald
(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
The multiplying villainies of nature
Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles
Of Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supplied,
And Fortune on his damned quarry smiling,
Showed like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name)
Disdaining Fortune, with his brandished steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution
(Like Valour's minion) carved out his passage,
Till he faced the slave:
Which never shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chops,
And fixed his head upon our battlements.

KING
O valiant cousin, worthy gentleman.

CAPTAIN
As whence the sun begins his reflection,
Shipwracking storms, and direful thunders:
So from that spring, whence comfort seemed to come,
Discomfort swells: Mark King of Scotland, mark,
No sooner Justice had, with Valour armed,
Compelled these skipping Kernes to trust their heels,
But the Norwegian lord, surveying vantage,
With furbished arms, and new supplies of men,
Began a fresh assault.

KING
Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?

CAPTAIN
Yes, as sparrows, eagles;
Or the hare, the lion:
If I say sooth, I must report they were
As cannons overcharged with double cracks,
So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
Or memorize another Golgotha,
I cannot tell: but I am faint,
My gashes cry for help.

KING
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds,
They smack of honor both: Go get him surgeons.

SD: Enter Rosse and Angus.

KING
Who comes here?

MALCOLM
The worthy Thane of Rosse.

LENOX
What a haste looks through his eyes?
So should he look that seems to speak things strange.

ROSSE
God save the King.

KING
Whence cam'st thou, worthy Thane?

ROSSE
From Fife, great King,
Where the Norwegian banners flout the sky,
And fan our people cold.
Norway himself, with terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,
The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapt in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Point against point, rebellious arm 'gainst arm,
Curbing his lavish spirit: and to conclude,
The victory fell on us.

KING
Great happiness.

ROSSE
That now Sweno, the Norway's King,
Craves composition:
Nor would we deign him burial of his men,
Till he disbursed, at Saint Colmes inch,
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

KING
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest: Go pronounce his present death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.

ROSSE
I'll see it done.

KING
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.

SD: Exeunt.
