NS: Act 3, Scene 1

SL: The drawing-room at “Highercoombe.” Facing the spectator are two large French windows, sheltered by a verandah, leading into the garden; on the right is a door opening into a small hall. The fireplace, with a large mirror above it, is on the left-hand side of the room, and higher up in the same wall are double doors recessed. The room is richly furnished, and everything betokens taste and luxury. The windows are open, and there is moonlight in the garden.

SD: Lady Orreyed, a pretty, affected doll of a woman with a mincing voice and flaxen hair, is sitting on the ottoman, her head resting against the drum, and her eyes closed. Paula, looking pale, worn, and thoroughly unhappy, is sitting at a table. Both are in sumptuous dinner-gowns.

LADY ORREYED
Opening her eyes. Well, I never! I dropped off! Feeling her hair. Just fancy! Where are the men?

PAULA
Icily. Outside, smoking.

SD: A Servant enters with coffee, which he hands to Lady Orreyed. Sir George Orreyed comes in by the window. He is a man of about thirty-five, with a low forehead, a receding chin, a vacuous expression, and an ominous redness about the nose.

LADY ORREYED
Taking coffee. Here’s Dodo.

SIR GEORGE
I say, the flies under the verandah make you swear.

SD: The Servant hands coffee to Paula, who declines it, then to Sir George, who takes a cup. Hi! wait a bit! He looks at the tray searchingly, then puts back his cup. Never mind. Quietly to Lady Orreyed.

SIR GEORGE
I say, they’re dooced sparin’ with their liqueur, ain’t they?

SD: The Servant goes out at window.

PAULA
To Sir George. Won’t you take coffee, George?

SIR GEORGE
No, thanks. It’s gettin’ near time for a whisky and potass. Approaching Paula, regarding Lady Orreyed admiringly. I say, Birdie looks rippin’ tonight, don’t she?

PAULA
Your wife?

SIR GEORGE
Yaas⁠—Birdie.

PAULA
Rippin’?

SIR GEORGE
Yaas.

PAULA
Quite⁠—quite rippin’.

SD: He moves round to the settee. Paula watches him with distaste, then rises and walks away. Sir George falls asleep on the settee.

LADY ORREYED
Paula love, I fancied you and Aubrey were a little more friendly at dinner. You haven’t made it up, have you?

PAULA
We? Oh, no. We speak before others, that’s all.

LADY ORREYED
And how long do you intend to carry on this game, dear?

PAULA
Turning away impatiently. I really can’t tell you.

LADY ORREYED
Sit down, old girl; don’t be so fidgety.

SD: Paula sits on the upper seat of the ottoman with her back to Lady Orreyed. Of course, it’s my duty, as an old friend, to give you a good talking-to⁠—Paula glares at her suddenly and fiercely⁠—but really I’ve found one gets so many smacks in the face through interfering in matrimonial squabbles that I’ve determined to drop it.

PAULA
I think you’re wise.

LADY ORREYED
However, I must say that I do wish you’d look at marriage in a more solemn light⁠—just as I do, in fact. It is such a beautiful thing⁠—marriage, and if people in our position don’t respect it, and set a good example by living happily with their husbands, what can you expect from the middle classes? When did this sad state of affairs between you and Aubrey actually begin?

PAULA
Actually, a fortnight and three days ago; I haven’t calculated the minutes.

LADY ORREYED
A day or two before Dodo and I turned up⁠—arrived.

PAULA
Yes. One always remembers one thing by another; we left off speaking to each other the morning I wrote asking you to visit us.

LADY ORREYED
Lucky for you I was able to pop down, wasn’t it, dear?

PAULA
Glaring at her again. Most fortunate.

LADY ORREYED
A serious split with your husband without a pal on the premises⁠—I should say, without a friend in the house⁠—would be most unpleasant.

PAULA
Turning to her abruptly. This place must be horribly doleful for you and George just now. At least you ought to consider him before me. Why don’t you leave me to my difficulties?

LADY ORREYED
Oh, we’re quite comfortable, dear, thank you⁠—both of us. George and me are so wrapped up in each other, it doesn’t matter where we are. I don’t want to crow over you, old girl, but I’ve got a perfect husband.

SD: Sir George is now fast asleep, his head thrown back and his mouth open, looking hideous.

PAULA
Glancing at Sir George. So you’ve given me to understand.

LADY ORREYED
Not that we don’t have our little differences. Why, we fell out only this very morning. You remember the diamond and ruby tiara Charley Prestwick gave poor dear Connie Tirlemont years ago, don’t you?

PAULA
No, I do not.

LADY ORREYED
No? Well, it’s in the market. Benjamin of Piccadilly has got it in his shopwindow, and I’ve set my heart on it.

PAULA
You consider it quite necessary?

LADY ORREYED
Yes, because what I say to Dodo is this⁠—a lady of my station must smother herself with hair ornaments. It’s different with you, love⁠—people don’t look for so much blaze from you, but I’ve got rank to keep up; haven’t I?

PAULA
Yes.

LADY ORREYED
Well, that was the cause of the little set-to between I and Dodo this morning. He broke two chairs, he was in such a rage. I forgot, they’re your chairs; do you mind?

PAULA
No.

LADY ORREYED
You know, poor Dodo can’t lose his temper without smashing something; if it isn’t a chair, it’s a mirror; if it isn’t that, it’s china⁠—a bit of Dresden for choice. Dear old pet! he loves a bit of Dresden when he’s furious. He doesn’t really throw things at me, dear; he simply lifts them up and drops them, like a gentleman. I expect our room upstairs will look rather wrecky before I get that tiara.

PAULA
Excuse the suggestion, perhaps your husband can’t afford it.

LADY ORREYED
Oh, how dreadfully changed you are, Paula! Dodo can always mortgage something, or borrow of his ma. What is coming to you!

PAULA
Ah!

SD: She sits at the piano and touches the keys.

LADY ORREYED
Oh, yes, do play! That’s the one thing I envy you for.

PAULA
What shall I play?

LADY ORREYED
What was that heavenly piece you gave us last night, dear?

PAULA
A bit of Schubert. Would you like to hear it again?

LADY ORREYED
You don’t know any comic songs, do you?

PAULA
I’m afraid not.

LADY ORREYED
I leave it to you, then.

SD: Paula plays. Aubrey and Cayley Drummle appear outside the window; they look into the room.

AUBREY
To Drummle. You can see her face in that mirror. Poor girl, how ill and wretched she looks.

DRUMMLE
When are the Orreyeds going?

AUBREY
Heaven knows!

SD: Entering the room.

DRUMMLE
But you’re entertaining them; what’s it to do with Heaven?

SD: Following Aubrey.

AUBREY
Do you know, Cayley, that even the Orreyeds serve a useful purpose? My wife actually speaks to me before our guests⁠—think of that! I’ve come to rejoice at the presence of the Orreyeds!

DRUMMLE
I daresay; we’re taught that beetles are sent for a benign end.

AUBREY
Cayley, talk to Paula again tonight.

DRUMMLE
Certainly, if I get the chance.

AUBREY
Let’s contrive it. George is asleep; perhaps I can get that doll out of the way.

SD: As they advance into the room, Paula abruptly ceases playing and finds interest in a volume of music. Sir George is now nodding and snoring apoplectically.

AUBREY
Lady Orreyed, whenever you feel inclined for a game of billiards I’m at your service.

LADY ORREYED
Jumping up. Charmed, I’m sure! I really thought you’d forgotten poor little me. Oh, look at Dodo!

AUBREY
No, no, don’t wake him; he’s tired.

LADY ORREYED
I must, he looks so plain. Rousing Sir George. Dodo! Dodo!

SIR GEORGE
Stupidly. ’Ullo!

LADY ORREYED
Dodo, dear, you were snoring.

SIR GEORGE
Oh, I say, you could ’a told me that by-and-by.

AUBREY
You want a cigar, George; come into the billiard room. Giving his arm to Lady Orreyed. Cayley, bring Paula.

SD: Aubrey and Lady Orreyed go out.

SIR GEORGE
Rising. Hey, what! billiard room! Looking at his watch. How goes the⁠—? Phew! ’Ullo, ’Ullo! Whisky and potass!

SD: He goes rapidly after Aubrey and Lady Orreyed. Paula resumes playing.

PAULA
After a pause. Don’t moon about after me, Cayley; follow the others.

DRUMMLE
Thanks, by-and-by. Sitting. That’s pretty.

PAULA
After another pause, still playing. I wish you wouldn’t stare so.

DRUMMLE
Was I staring? I’m sorry.

SD: She plays a little longer, then stops suddenly, rises, and goes to the window, where she stands looking out. Drummle moves from the ottoman to the settee.

DRUMMLE
A lovely night.

PAULA
Startled. Oh! Without turning to him. Why do you hop about like a monkey?

DRUMMLE
Hot rooms play the deuce with the nerves. Now, it would have done you good to have walked in the garden with us after dinner and made merry. Why didn’t you?

PAULA
You know why.

DRUMMLE
Ah, you’re thinking of the⁠—difference between you and Aubrey?

PAULA
Yes, I am thinking of it.

DRUMMLE
Well, so am I. How long⁠—?

PAULA
Getting on for three weeks.

DRUMMLE
Bless me, it must be! And this would have been such a night to have healed it! Moonlight, the stars, the scent of flowers; and yet enough darkness to enable a kind woman to rest her hand for an instant on the arm of a good fellow who loves her. Ah, ha! it’s a wonderful power, dear Mrs. Aubrey, the power of an offended woman! Only realise it! Just that one touch⁠—the mere tips of her fingers⁠—and, for herself and another, she changes the colour of the whole world!

PAULA
Turning to him, calmly. Cayley, my dear man, you talk exactly like a very romantic old lady.

SD: She leaves the window and sits playing with the knickknacks on the table.

DRUMMLE
To himself. H’m, that hasn’t done it! Well⁠—ha, ha!⁠—I accept the suggestion. An old woman, eh?

PAULA
Oh, I didn’t intend⁠—

DRUMMLE
But why not? I’ve every qualification⁠—well, almost. And I confess it would have given this withered bosom a throb of grandmotherly satisfaction if I could have seen you and Aubrey at peace before I take my leave tomorrow.

PAULA
Tomorrow, Cayley!

DRUMMLE
I must.

PAULA
Oh, this house is becoming unendurable.

DRUMMLE
You’re very kind. But you’ve got the Orreyeds.

PAULA
Fiercely. The Orreyeds! I⁠—I hate the Orreyeds! I lie awake at night, hating them!

DRUMMLE
Pardon me, I’ve understood that their visit is, in some degree, owing to⁠—hem!⁠—your suggestion.

PAULA
Heavens! that doesn’t make me like them better. Somehow or another, I⁠—I’ve outgrown these people. This woman⁠—I used to think her “jolly!”⁠—sickens me. I can’t breathe when she’s near me: the whiff of her handkerchief turns me faint! And she patronises me by the hour, until I⁠—I feel my nails growing longer with every word she speaks!

DRUMMLE
My dear lady, why on earth don’t you say all this to Aubrey?

PAULA
Oh, I’ve been such an utter fool, Cayley!

DRUMMLE
Soothingly. Well, well, mention it to Aubrey!

PAULA
No, no, you don’t understand. What do you think I’ve done?

DRUMMLE
Done! What, since you invited the Orreyeds?

PAULA
Yes; I must tell you⁠—

DRUMMLE
Perhaps you’d better not.

PAULA
Look here. I’ve intercepted some letters from Mrs. Cortelyon and Ellean to⁠—him. Producing three unopened letters from the bodice of her dress. There are the accursed things! From Paris⁠—two from the Cortelyon woman, the other from Ellean!

DRUMMLE
But why⁠—why?

PAULA
I don’t know. Yes, I do! I saw letters coming from Ellean to her father; not a line to me⁠—not a line. And one morning it happened I was downstairs before he was, and I spied this one lying with his heap on the breakfast-table, and I slipped it into my pocket⁠—out of malice, Cayley, pure devilry! And a day or two afterwards I met Elwes the postman at the Lodge, and took the letters from him, and found these others amongst ’em. I felt simply fiendish when I saw them⁠—fiendish! Returning the letters to her bodice. And now I carry them about with me, and they’re scorching me like a mustard plaster!

DRUMMLE
Oh, this accounts for Aubrey not hearing from Paris lately!

PAULA
That’s an ingenious conclusion to arrive at! Of course it does! With an hysterical laugh. Ha, ha!

DRUMMLE
Well, well! Laughing. Ha, ha, ha!

PAULA
Turning upon him. I suppose it is amusing!

DRUMMLE
I beg pardon.

PAULA
Heaven knows I’ve little enough to brag about! I’m a bad lot, but not in mean tricks of this sort. In all my life this is the most caddish thing I’ve done. How am I to get rid of these letters⁠—that’s what I want to know? How am I to get rid of them?

DRUMMLE
If I were you I should take Aubrey aside and put them into his hands as soon as possible.

PAULA
What! and tell him to his face that I⁠—! No, thank you. I suppose you wouldn’t like to⁠—

DRUMMLE
No, no; I won’t touch ’em!

PAULA
And you call yourself my friend?

DRUMMLE
Good-humouredly. No, I don’t!

PAULA
Perhaps I’ll tie them together and give them to his man in the morning.

DRUMMLE
That won’t avoid an explanation.

PAULA
Recklessly. Oh, then he must miss them⁠—

DRUMMLE
And trace them.

PAULA
Throwing herself upon the ottoman. I don’t care!

DRUMMLE
I know you don’t; but let me send him to you now, may I?

PAULA
Now! What do you think a woman’s made of? I couldn’t stand it, Cayley. I haven’t slept for nights; and last night there was thunder, too! I believe I’ve got the horrors.

DRUMMLE
Taking the little hand-mirror from the table. You’ll sleep well enough when you deliver those letters. Come, come, Mrs. Aubrey⁠—a good night’s rest! Holding the mirror before her face. It’s quite time.

SD: She looks at herself for a moment, then snatches the mirror from him.

PAULA
You brute, Cayley, to show me that!

DRUMMLE
Then⁠—may I? Be guided by a fr⁠—a poor old woman! May I?

PAULA
You’ll kill me, amongst you!

DRUMMLE
What do you say?

PAULA
After a pause. Very well.

SD: He nods his head and goes out rapidly. She looks after him for a moment, and calls “Cayley! Cayley!” Then she again produces the letters, deliberately, one by one, fingering them with aversion. Suddenly she starts, turning her head towards the door. Ah!

SD: Aubrey enters quickly.

AUBREY
Paula!

PAULA
Handing him the letters, her face averted. There!

SD: He examines the letters, puzzled, and looks at her inquiringly. They are many days old.

PAULA
I stole them, I suppose to make you anxious and unhappy.

SD: He looks at the letters again, then lays them aside on the table.

AUBREY
Gently. Paula, dear, it doesn’t matter.

PAULA
After a short pause. Why⁠—why do you take it like this?

AUBREY
What did you expect?

PAULA
Oh, but I suppose silent reproaches are really the severest. And then, naturally, you are itching to open your letters.

SD: She crosses the room as if to go.

AUBREY
Paula!

SD: She pauses.

AUBREY
Surely, surely it’s all over now?

PAULA
All over! Mockingly. Has my stepdaughter returned then? When did she arrive? I haven’t heard of it!

AUBREY
You can be very cruel.

PAULA
That word’s always on a man’s lips; he uses it if his soup’s cold. With another movement as if to go. Need we⁠—

AUBREY
I know I’ve wounded you, Paula. But isn’t there any way out of this?

PAULA
When does Ellean return? Tomorrow? Next week?

AUBREY
Wearily. Oh! Why should we grudge Ellean the little pleasure she is likely to find in Paris and in London.

PAULA
I grudge her nothing, if that’s a hit at me. But with that woman⁠—!

AUBREY
It must be that woman or another. You know that at present we are unable to give Ellean the opportunity of⁠—of⁠—

PAULA
Of mixing with respectable people.

AUBREY
The opportunity of gaining friends, experience, ordinary knowledge of the world. If you are interested in Ellean, can’t you see how useful Mrs. Cortelyon’s good offices are?

PAULA
May I put one question? At the end of the London season, when Mrs. Cortelyon has done with Ellean, is it quite understood that the girl comes back to us?

SD: Aubrey is silent.

PAULA
Is it? Is it?

AUBREY
Let us wait till the end of the season⁠—

PAULA
Oh! I knew it. You’re only fooling me; you put me off with any trash. I believe you’ve sent Ellean away, not for the reasons you give, but because you don’t consider me a decent companion for her, because you’re afraid she might get a little of her innocence rubbed off in my company? Come, isn’t that the truth? Be honest! Isn’t that it?

AUBREY
Yes.

SD: There is a moment’s silence on both sides.

PAULA
With uplifted hands as if to strike him. Oh!

SD: Aubrey takes her by the wrists.

AUBREY
Sit down. Sit down.

SD: He puts her into a chair; she shakes herself free with a cry. Now listen to me.

AUBREY
Fond as you are, Paula, of harking back to your past, there’s one chapter of it you always let alone. I’ve never asked you to speak of it; you’ve never offered to speak of it. I mean the chapter that relates to the time when you were⁠—like Ellean.

SD: She attempts to rise; he restrains her.

AUBREY
No, no.

PAULA
I don’t choose to talk about that time. I won’t satisfy your curiosity.

AUBREY
My dear Paula, I have no curiosity⁠—I know what you were at Ellean’s age. I’ll tell you. You hadn’t a thought that wasn’t a wholesome one, you hadn’t an impulse that didn’t tend towards good, you never harboured a notion you couldn’t have gossiped about to a parcel of children.

SD: She makes another effort to rise: he lays his hand lightly on her shoulder.

AUBREY
And this was a very few years back⁠—there are days now when you look like a schoolgirl⁠—but think of the difference between the two Paulas. You’ll have to think hard, because after a cruel life one’s perceptions grow a thick skin. But, for God’s sake, do think till you get these two images clearly in your mind, and then ask yourself what sort of a friend such a woman as you are today would have been for the girl of seven or eight years ago.

PAULA
Rising. How dare you? I could be almost as good a friend to Ellean as her own mother would have been had she lived. I know what you mean. How dare you?

AUBREY
You say that; very likely you believe it. But you’re blind, Paula; you’re blind. You! Every belief that a young, pure-minded girl holds sacred⁠—that you once held sacred⁠—you now make a target for a jest, a sneer, a paltry cynicism. I tell you, you’re not mistress any longer of your thoughts or your tongue. Why, how often, sitting between you and Ellean, have I seen her cheeks turn scarlet as you’ve rattled off some tale that belongs by right to the club or the smoking-room! Have you noticed the blush? If you have, has the cause of it ever struck you? And this is the girl you say you love, I admit that you do love, whose love you expect in return! Oh, Paula, I make the best, the only, excuse for you when I tell you you’re blind!

PAULA
Ellean⁠—Ellean blushes easily.

AUBREY
You blushed as easily a few years ago.

PAULA
After a short pause. Well! Have you finished your sermon?

AUBREY
With a gesture of despair. Oh, Paula!

SD: Going up to the window and standing with his back to the room.

PAULA
To herself. A few⁠—years ago!

SD: She walks slowly towards the door, then suddenly drops upon the ottoman in a paroxysm of weeping.

PAULA
O God! A few years ago!

SD: Aubrey goes to her.

AUBREY
Paula!

PAULA
Sobbing. Oh, don’t touch me!

AUBREY
Paula!

PAULA
Oh, go away from me!

SD: He goes back a few steps, and after a little while she becomes calmer and rises unsteadily; then in an altered tone.

PAULA
Look here⁠—!

SD: He advances a step; she checks him with a quick gesture.

PAULA
Look here! Get rid of these people⁠—Mabel and her husband⁠—as soon as possible! I⁠—I’ve done with them!

AUBREY
In a whisper. Paula!

PAULA
And then⁠—then⁠—when the time comes for Ellean to leave Mrs. Cortelyon, give me⁠—give me another chance!

SD: He advances again, but she shrinks away.

PAULA
No, no!

SD: She goes out by the door on the right. He sinks on to the settee, covering his eyes with his hands. There is a brief silence, then a Servant enters.

SERVANT
Mrs. Cortelyon, sir, with Miss Ellean.

SD: Aubrey rises to meet Mrs. Cortelyon, who enters, followed by Ellean, both being in travelling dresses. The Servant withdraws.

MRS. CORTEYLON
Shaking hands with Aubrey. Oh, my dear Aubrey!

AUBREY
Mrs. Cortelyon! Kissing Ellean. Ellean dear!

ELLEAN
Papa, is all well at home?

MRS. CORTEYLON
We’re shockingly anxious.

AUBREY
Yes, yes, all’s well. This is quite unexpected. To Mrs. Cortelyon. You’ve found Paris insufferably hot?

MRS. CORTEYLON
Insufferably hot! Paris is pleasant enough. We’ve had no letter from you!

AUBREY
I wrote to Ellean a week ago.

MRS. CORTEYLON
Without alluding to the subject I had written to you upon.

AUBREY
Thinking. Ah, of course⁠—

MRS. CORTEYLON
And since then we’ve both written and you’ve been absolutely silent. Oh, it’s too bad!

AUBREY
Picking up the letters from the table. It isn’t altogether my fault. Here are the letters⁠—

ELLEAN
Papa!

MRS. CORTEYLON
They’re unopened.

AUBREY
An accident delayed their reaching me till this evening. I’m afraid this has upset you very much.

MRS. CORTEYLON
Upset me!

ELLEAN
In an undertone to Mrs. Cortelyon. Never mind. Not now, dear⁠—not tonight.

AUBREY
Eh?

MRS. CORTEYLON
To Ellean aloud. Child, run away and take your things off. She doesn’t look as if she’d journeyed from Paris today.

AUBREY
I’ve never seen her with such a colour.

SD: Taking Ellean’s hands.

ELLEAN
To Aubrey, in a faint voice. Papa, Mrs. Cortelyon has been so very, very kind to me, but I⁠—I have come home.

SD: She goes out.

AUBREY
Come home! To Mrs. Cortelyon. Ellean returns to us, then?

MRS. CORTEYLON
That’s the very point I put to you in my letters, and you oblige me to travel from Paris to Willowmere on a warm day to settle it. I think perhaps it’s right that Ellean should be with you just now, although I⁠—My dear friend, circumstances are a little altered.

AUBREY
Alice, you’re in some trouble.

MRS. CORTEYLON
Well⁠—yes, I am in trouble. You remember pretty little Mrs. Brereton who was once Caroline Ardale?

AUBREY
Quite well.

MRS. CORTEYLON
She’s a widow now, poor thing. She has the entresol of the house where we’ve been lodging in the Avenue de Friedland. Caroline’s a dear chum of mine; she formed a great liking for Ellean.

AUBREY
I’m very glad.

MRS. CORTEYLON
Yes, it’s nice for her to meet her mother’s friends. Er⁠—that young Hugh Ardale the papers were full of some time ago⁠—he’s Caroline Brereton’s brother, you know.

AUBREY
No, I didn’t know. What did he do? I forget.

MRS. CORTEYLON
Checked one of those horrid mutinies at some faraway station in India, marched down with a handful of his men and a few faithful natives, and held the place until he was relieved. They gave him his company and a V.C. for it.

AUBREY
And he’s Mrs. Brereton’s brother?

MRS. CORTEYLON
Yes. He’s with his sister⁠—was, rather⁠—in Paris. He’s home⁠—invalided. Good gracious, Aubrey, why don’t you help me out? Can’t you guess what has occurred?

AUBREY
Alice!

MRS. CORTEYLON
Young Ardale⁠—Ellean!

AUBREY
An attachment?

MRS. CORTEYLON
Yes, Aubrey. After a little pause. Well, I suppose I’ve got myself into sad disgrace. But really I didn’t foresee anything of this kind. A serious, reserved child like Ellean, and a boyish, high-spirited soldier⁠—it never struck me as being likely.

SD: Aubrey paces to and fro thoughtfully.

MRS. CORTEYLON
I did all I could directly Captain Ardale spoke⁠—wrote to you at once. Why on earth don’t you receive your letters promptly, and when you do get them why can’t you open them? I endured the anxiety till last night, and then made up my mind⁠—home! Of course, it has worried me terribly. My head’s bursting. Are there any salts about?

SD: Aubrey fetches a bottle from the cabinet and hands it to her.

MRS. CORTEYLON
We’ve had one of those hateful smooth crossings that won’t let you be properly indisposed.

AUBREY
My dear Alice, I assure you I’ve no thought of blaming you.

MRS. CORTEYLON
That statement always precedes a quarrel.

AUBREY
I don’t know whether this is the worst or the best luck. How will my wife regard it? Is Captain Ardale a good fellow?

MRS. CORTEYLON
My dear Aubrey, you’d better read up the accounts of his wonderful heroism. Face to face with death for a whole week; always with a smile and a cheering word for the poor helpless souls depending on him! Of course, it’s that that has stirred the depths of your child’s nature. I’ve watched her while we’ve been dragging the story out of him, and if angels look different from Ellean at that moment, I don’t desire to meet any, that’s all!

AUBREY
If you were in my position⁠—? But you can’t judge.

MRS. CORTEYLON
Why, if I had a marriageable daughter of my own and Captain Ardale proposed for her, naturally I should cry my eyes out all night⁠—but I should thank Heaven in the morning.

AUBREY
You believe so thoroughly in him?

MRS. CORTEYLON
Do you think I should have only a headache at this minute if I didn’t! Look here, you’ve got to see me down the lane; that’s the least you can do, my friend. Come into my house for a moment and shake hands with Hugh.

AUBREY
What, is he here?

MRS. CORTEYLON
He came through with us, to present himself formally tomorrow. Where are my gloves?

SD: Aubrey fetches them from the ottoman.

MRS. CORTEYLON
Make my apologies to Mrs. Tanqueray, please. She’s well, I hope? Going towards the door. I can’t feel sorry she hasn’t seen me in this condition.

SD: Ellean enters.

ELLEAN
To Mrs. Cortelyon. I’ve been waiting to wish you good night. I was afraid I’d missed you.

MRS. CORTEYLON
Good night, Ellean.

ELLEAN
In a low voice, embracing Mrs. Cortelyon. I can’t thank you. Dear Mrs. Cortelyon!

MRS. CORTEYLON
Her arms round Ellean, in a whisper to Aubrey. Speak a word to her.

SD: Mrs. Cortelyon goes out.

AUBREY
To Ellean. Ellean, I’m going to see Mrs. Cortelyon home. Tell Paula where I am; explain, dear.

SD: Going to the door.

ELLEAN
Her head drooping. Yes. Quickly. Father! You are angry with me⁠—disappointed?

AUBREY
Angry?⁠—no.

ELLEAN
Disappointed?

AUBREY
Smiling and going to her and taking her hand. If so, it’s only because you’ve shaken my belief in my discernment. I thought you took after your poor mother a little, Ellean; but there’s a look on your face tonight, dear, that I never saw on hers⁠—never, never.

ELLEAN
Leaning her head on his shoulder. Perhaps I ought not to have gone away?

AUBREY
Hush! You’re quite happy?

ELLEAN
Yes.

AUBREY
That’s right. Then, as you are quite happy there is something I particularly want you to do for me Ellean.

ELLEAN
What is that?

AUBREY
Be very gentle with Paula. Will you?

ELLEAN
You think I have been unkind.

AUBREY
Kissing her upon the forehead. Be very gentle with Paula.

SD: He goes out and she stands looking after him, then, as she turns thoughtfully from the door, a rose is thrown through the window and falls at her feet. She picks up the flower wonderingly and goes to the window.

ELLEAN
Starting back. Hugh!

SD: Hugh Ardale, a handsome young man of about seven-and-twenty, with a boyish face and manner, appears outside the window.

HUGH
Nelly! Nelly dear!

ELLEAN
What’s the matter?

HUGH
Hush! Nothing. It’s only fun. Laughing. Ha, ha, ha! I’ve found out that Mrs. Cortelyon’s meadow runs up to your father’s plantation; I’ve come through a gap in the hedge.

ELLEAN
Why, Hugh?

HUGH
I’m miserable at The Warren; it’s so different from the Avenue de Friedland. Don’t look like that! Upon my word I meant just to peep at your home and go back, but I saw figures moving about here, and came nearer, hoping to get a glimpse of you. Was that your father?

SD: Entering the room.

ELLEAN
Yes.

HUGH
Isn’t this fun! A rabbit ran across my foot while I was hiding behind that old yew.

ELLEAN
You must go away; it’s not right for you to be here like this.

HUGH
But it’s only fun, I tell you. You take everything so seriously. Do wish me good night.

ELLEAN
We have said good night.

HUGH
In the hall at The Warren before Mrs. Cortelyon and a manservant. Oh, it’s so different from the Avenue de Friedland!

ELLEAN
Giving him her hand hastily. Good night, Hugh.

HUGH
Is that all? We might be the merest acquaintances.

SD: He momentarily embraces her, but she releases herself.

ELLEAN
It’s when you’re like this that you make me feel utterly miserable. Throwing the rose from her angrily. Oh!

HUGH
I’ve offended you now, I suppose?

ELLEAN
Yes.

HUGH
Forgive me, Nelly. Come into the garden for five minutes; we’ll stroll down to the plantation.

ELLEAN
No, no.

HUGH
For two minutes⁠—to tell me you forgive me.

ELLEAN
I forgive you.

HUGH
Evidently. I shan’t sleep a wink tonight after this. What a fool I am! Come down to the plantation. Make it up with me.

ELLEAN
There is somebody coming into this room. Do you wish to be seen here?

HUGH
I shall wait for you behind that yew tree. You must speak to me. Nelly!

SD: He disappears. Paula enters.

PAULA
Ellean!

ELLEAN
You⁠—you are very surprised to see me, Paula, of course.

PAULA
Why are you here? Why aren’t you with⁠—your friend?
