NS: Act 1, Scene 2

SL: Don Cæsar's.

SD: Enter OLIVIA and MINETTE, R.

OLIVIA
Well, here we are in private--what is this charming
intelligence of which thou art so full this morning?

MINETTE
Why, ma'am, as I was in the balcony that overlooks Don Vasquez's
garden, Donna Marcella told me, that Don Cæsar had last night been to
pay her a visit previous to their marriage, and--

OLIVIA
Their marriage! How can you give me the intelligence with such a
look of joy? Their marriage!--what will become of me?

MINETTE
Dear ma'am! if you'll but have patience.--She says that, Don
Cæsar and she are perfectly agreed--

OLIVIA
Still with that smirking face?--I can't have patience.

MINETTE
Then, madam, if you won't let me tell the story, please to read
it----Here's a letter from Donna Marcella.

OLIVIA
Why did you not give it me at first? 

SD: [Reads.]

MINETTE
Because I didn't like to be cut out of my story. If orators were
obliged to come to the point at once, mercy on us! what tropes and
figures we should lose!

OLIVIA
Oh, Minette! I give you leave to smirk again--listen. 

SD: [Reads.] I am more terrified at the idea of becoming your father's wife, than
you are in expectation of a stepmother; and Don Cæsar would be as loath
as either of us.--He only means to frighten you into matrimony, and I
have, on certain conditions, agreed to assist him; but, whatever you may
hear, or see, be assured that nothing is so impossible, as that he
should become the husband of Donna Marcella._--Oh, delightful girl! how
I love her for this!

MINETTE
Yes, ma'am; and if you'd had patience, I should have told you
that she's now here with Don Cæsar, in grave debate how to begin the
attack; which must force you to take shelter in the arms of a husband.

OLIVIA
Ah, no matter how they begin it. Let them amuse themselves in
raising batteries; my reserved fire shall tumble them about their ears,
in the moment my poor father is singing his Io's for victory.--But here
come the lovers--Well, I protest now, sixteen and sixty is a very comely
sight.--'Tis contrast gives effect to every thing.--Lud! how my father
ogles! I had no idea he was such a sort of man. I am really afraid he
isn't quite so good as he should be!

SD: Enter DON CÆSAR, leading MARCELLA, L.

CÆSAR
H--um! Madam looks very placid; we shall discompose her, or I
am mistaken. 

SD: [Apart.] So, Olivia, here's Donna Marcella come to visit
you--though, as matters are, that respect is due from you.

OLIVIA
I am sensible of the condescension. My dear ma'am, how very good
this is! 

SD: [Taking her hand.]

CÆSAR
Yes, you'll think yourself wonderfully obliged, when you know
all! 

SD: [Aside.] Pray, Donna Marcella, what do you think of these
apartments?--The furniture and decorations are my daughter's taste;
would you wish them to remain, or will you give orders to have them
changed?

MARCELLA
Changed, undoubtedly; I can have nobody's taste govern my
apartments but my own.

CÆSAR
Ah that touches!--See how she looks!--

SD: [Apart.] They shall
receive your orders.--You understand, I suppose, from this, that every
thing is fixed on between Donna Marcella and me?

OLIVIA
Yes, sir; I understand it perfectly; and it gives me infinite
pleasure.

CÆSAR
Eh! pleasure?

OLIVIA
Entirely, sir----

CÆSAR
Tol-de-rol! Ah, that wont do--that wont do! You can't hide
it.--You are frightened out of your wits at the thoughts of a
mother-in-law; especially a young, gay, handsome one.

OLIVIA
Pardon me, sir; the thought of a mother-in-law was indeed
disagreeable; but her being young and gay qualifies it.----I hope,
ma'am, you'll give us balls, and the most spirited parties. 

SD: [Crosses, C.] You can't think how stupid we have been. My dear father hates those
things; but I hope now--

CÆSAR
Hey! hey! hey! what's the meaning of all this? Why, hussy,
don't you know you'll have no apartment but the garret?

OLIVIA
That will benefit my complexion, sir, by mending my health. 'Tis
charming to sleep in an elevated situation.

CÆSAR
Here! here's an obstinate perverse slut!

OLIVIA
Bless me, sir, are you angry that I look forward to your
marriage without murmuring?

CÆSAR
Yes, I am--yes, I am; you ought to murmur; and you ought
to--to--to----

OLIVIA
Dear me! I find love, taken up late in life, has a bad effect on
the temper.--I wish, my dear papa, you had felt the influence of Donna
Marcella's charms somewhat sooner.

CÆSAR
You do! you do! why this must be all put on.--This can't be
real.

OLIVIA
Indeed, indeed it is; and I protest, your engagement with this
lady has given me more pleasure than I have tasted ever since you began
to tease me about a husband. You seem determined to have a marriage in
the family; and I hope, now, I shall live in quiet, with my dear, sweet,
young mother-in-law.

CÆSAR
Oh! oh! 

SD: [Walking about.] Was there ever--

SD: [Crosses, C.] She
doesn't care for a mother-in-law!--Can't frighten her!

OLIVIA
Sure, my fate is very peculiar; that being pleased with your
choice, and submitting, with humble duty, to your will, should be the
cause of offence.

CÆSAR
Hussy! I don't want you to be pleased with my choice--I don't
want you to submit with humble duty to my will.--Where I do want you to
submit, you rebel: you are a--you are----But I'll mortify that wayward
spirit, yet.

SD: Exit DON CÆSAR and MARCELLA, R.

MINETTE
Well, really, my master is in a piteous passion; he seems more
angry at your liking his marriage, than at your refusing to be married
yourself.----Wouldn't it have been better, madam, to have affected
discontent?

OLIVIA
To what purpose, but to lay myself open to fresh solicitations,
in order to get rid of the evil I pretended to dread? Bless us! nothing
can be more easy than for my father to be gratified, if he were but
lucky in the choice of a lover.

MINETTE
As much as to say, madam, that there is--

OLIVIA
Why, yes, as much as to say--I see you are resolved to have my
secret, Minette, and so--

SD: Enter SERVANT, L.

SERVANT
There is a gentleman at the door, madam, called Don Julio de
Melessina. He waits on you from Don Vincentio.

OLIVIA
Who? Don Julio! it cannot be--art thou sure of his name?

SERVANT
The servant repeated it twice. He is in a fine carriage, and
seems to be a nobleman.

OLIVIA
Conduct him hither. 

SD: Exit SERVANT, L. I am astonished! I
cannot see him! I would not have him know the incognita to be Olivia,
for worlds!--There is but one way. 

SD: [Aside.] Minette, ask no questions;
but do as I order you.--Receive Don Julio in my name; call yourself the
heiress of Don Cæsar; and on no account suffer him to believe that you
are any thing else.

SD: Exit, R.

MINETTE
So, then, this is some new lover she is determined to disgust;
and fancies, that making me pass for her will complete it. Perhaps her
ladyship may be mistaken though.--

SD: [Looking through the wing.]--Upon my
word a sweet man! Oh, lud! my heart beats at the very idea of his making
love to me, even though he takes me for another! Stay! I think he shan't
find me here. Standing in the middle of a room gives one's appearance no
effect. I'll enter upon him with an easy swim, or an engaging trip, or
a--something that shall strike--the first glance is every thing.

SD: Exit, R.

SD: Enter DON JULIO, L., preceded by a SERVANT, who retires, R.

JULIO
Not here! The ridiculous dispute between Garcia and Vincentio
gives me irresistible curiosity; though, if she is the character Garcia
describes, I expect to be cuffed for my impertinence.--Here she
comes!--A pretty, smiling girl, 'faith, for a vixen!

SD: Enter MINETTE, R., very affectedly.

MINETTE
Sir, your most obedient humble servant.--You are Don Julio de
Melessina. I am extremely glad to see you, sir.

JULIO
SD: [Aside.] A very courteous reception!--You honour me
infinitely, madam. I must apologize for waiting on you without a better
introduction. Don Vincentio promised to attend me; but a concert called
him to another part of the town, at the moment I prepared to come
hither.

MINETTE
A concert--Yes, sir, he is very fond of music.

JULIO
He is, madam:--You, I suppose, have a passion for that charming
science?

MINETTE
Oh, yes, I love it mightily.

JULIO
SD: [Aside.] This is lucky! I think I have heard, Donna Olivia,
that your taste that way is peculiar; you are fond of a----'faith, I can
hardly speak it, 

SD: [Aside.] --of a----Jew's-harp. 

SD: [Smothering a laugh.]

MINETTE
A Jew's-harp! Mercy! What, do you think a person of my birth and
figure, can have such fancies as that?----No, sir, I love fiddles,
French horns, tabors, and all the cheerful, noisy instruments in the
world.

JULIO
SD: [Aside.] Vincentio must have been mad; and I as mad as he, to
mention it. Then you are fond of concerts, madam?

MINETTE
Dote on them! I wish he'd offer me a ticket. 

SD: [Aside.]

JULIO
SD: [Aside.] Vincentio is clearly wrong.--Now to prove how far
the other was right, in supposing her a vixen.

MINETTE
There is a grand public concert, sir, to be to-morrow. Pray, do
you go?

JULIO
I believe I shall have that pleasure, madam.

MINETTE
My father, Don Cæsar, won't let me purchase a ticket: I think
it's very hard.

JULIO
Pardon me--I think it's perfectly right.

MINETTE
Right! what, to refuse me a trifling expense, that would procure
me a great pleasure?

JULIO
Yes, doubtless--the ladies are too fond of pleasure: I think
Don Cæsar is exemplary.

MINETTE
Lord, sir! you'd think it very hard, if you were me, to be locked
up all your life; and know nothing of the world but what you could catch
through the bars of your balcony.

JULIO
Perhaps I might; but, as a man, I am convinced 'tis right.
Daughters and wives should be equally excluded those destructive haunts
of dissipation. Let them keep to their embroidery, nor ever presume to
show their faces but at their own firesides.----This will bring out the
Xantippe, surely! 

SD: [Aside.]

MINETTE
Well, sir, I don't know--to be sure, home, as you say, is the
fittest place for women. For my part, I could live for ever at home. I
am determined he shall have his way; who knows what may happen?

SD: [Aside.]

JULIO
SD: [Aside.] By all the powers of caprice, Garcia is as wrong as
the other!

MINETTE
I delight in nothing so much as in sitting by my father, and
hearing his tales of old times; and I fancy, when I have a husband, I
shall be more happy to sit and listen to his stories of present times.

JULIO
Perhaps your husband, fair lady, might not be inclined so to
amuse you. Men have a thousand delights that call them abroad; and
probably your chief amusements would be counting the hours of his
absence, and giving a tear to each as it passed.

MINETTE
Well, he should never see them, however. I would always smile
when he entered; and if he found my eyes red, I'd say, I had been
weeping over the history of the unfortunate damsel, whose true love
hung himself at sea, and appeared to her after wards in a wet
jacket.--Sure, this will do! 

SD: [Aside.]

JULIO
I am every moment more astonished. Pray, madam, permit me a
question. Are you, really--yet I cannot doubt it--are you, really, Donna
Olivia, the daughter of Don Cæsar, to whom Don Garcia and Don Vincentio
had lately the honour of paying their addresses?

MINETTE
Am I Donna Olivia! ha! ha! ha! what a question! Pray, sir, is
this my father's house?--Are you Don Julio?

JULIO
I beg your pardon; but, to confess, I had heard you described
as a lady who had not quite so much sweetness, and----

MINETTE
Oh! what, you had heard that I was a termagant, I suppose.--'Tis
all slander, sir: there is not in Madrid, though I say it, a sweeter
temper than my own; and though I have refused a good many lovers, yet,
if one was to offer himself that I could like--

JULIO
You would take pity, and reward his passion.

MINETTE
I would.

JULIO
Lovely Donna Olivia, how charming is this frankness!--'Tis a
little odd, though! 

SD: [Aside.]

MINETTE
Why, I believe I should take pity: for it always seemed to me to
be very hard-hearted, to be cruel to a lover that one likes, because, in
that case, one should--a--you know, sir, the sooner the affair is over,
the better for both parties.

JULIO
What the deuce does she mean?--Is this Garcia's sour fruit?

CÆSAR
SD: [Without, R.] Olivia! Olivia!

MINETTE
Bless me, I hear my father! Now, sir, I have a particular fancy
that you should not tell him, in this first visit, your design.

JULIO
Madam, my design!

MINETTE
Yes, that you will not speak out, till we have had a little
further conversation, which I'll take care to give you an opportunity
for very soon. He'll be here in a moment: now, pray, Don Julio, go. If
he should meet you, and ask who you are, you can say, that you are--you
may say, that you came on a visit to my maid, you know.

SD: Exit, R.

JULIO
I thank you, madam, 

SD: [Aloud.] for my dismission. 

SD: [Aside.] I
never was in such a peril in my life. I believe she has a license in her
pocket, a priest in her closet, and the ceremony by heart.

SD: Exit.
