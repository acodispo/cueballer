NS: Act 1, Scene 1

SL: Roebuck Ramsden's study.

SD: Roebuck Ramsden is in his study, opening the morning letters.

RAMSDEN
(concluding the handshake and cheering up)
Well, well, Octavius, it's the common lot. We must all face it someday. Sit down.

OCTAVIUS
Yes: we must face it, Mr Ramsden. But I owed him a great deal. He did everything for me that my father could have done if he had lived.


RAMSDEN
He had no son of his own, you see.

OCTAVIUS
But he had daughters; and yet he was as good to my sister as to me. And his death was so sudden! I always intended to thank him--to let him know that I had not taken all his care of me as a matter of course, as any boy takes his father's care. But I waited for an opportunity and now he is dead--dropped without a moment's warning. He will never know what I felt. 
(He takes out his handkerchief and cries unaffectedly)


RAMSDEN
How do we know that, Octavius? He may know it: we cannot tell. Come! Don't grieve. 
(Octavius masters himself and puts up his handkerchief)
That's right. Now let me tell you something to console you. The last time I saw him--it was in this very room--he said to me: "Tavy is a generous lad and the soul of honor; and when I see how little consideration other men get from their sons, I realize how much better than a son he's been to me." There! Doesn't that do you good?

OCTAVIUS
Mr Ramsden: he used to say to me that he had met only one man in the world who was the soul of honor, and that was Roebuck Ramsden.

RAMSDEN
Oh, that was his partiality: we were very old friends, you know. But there was something else he used to say about you. I wonder whether I ought to tell you or not!

OCTAVIUS
You know best.

RAMSDEN
It was something about his daughter.

OCTAVIUS
(eagerly)
About Ann! Oh, do tell me that, Mr Ramsden.

RAMSDEN
Well, he said he was glad, after all, you were not his son, because he thought that someday Annie and you--
(Octavius blushes vividly)
Well, perhaps I shouldn't have told you. But he was in earnest.

OCTAVIUS
Oh, if only I thought I had a chance! You know, Mr Ramsden, I don't care about money or about what people call position; and I can't bring myself to take an interest in the business of struggling for them. Well, Ann has a most exquisite nature; but she is so accustomed to be in the thick of that sort of thing that she thinks a man's character incomplete if he is not ambitious. She knows that if she married me she would have to reason herself out of being ashamed of me for not being a big success of some kind.

RAMSDEN
(Getting up and planting himself with his back to the fireplace)
Nonsense, my boy, nonsense! You're too modest. What does she know about the real value of men at her age? 
(More seriously)
Besides, she's a wonderfully dutiful girl. Her father's wish would be sacred to her. Do you know that since she grew up to years of discretion, I don't believe she has ever once given her own wish as a reason for doing anything or not doing it. It's always "Father wishes me to," or "Mother wouldn't like it." It's really almost a fault in her. I have often told her she must learn to think for herself.

OCTAVIUS
(shaking his head)
I couldn't ask her to marry me because her father wished it, Mr Ramsden.

RAMSDEN
Well, perhaps not. No: of course not. I see that. No: you certainly couldn't. But when you win her on your own merits, it will be a great happiness to her to fulfil her father's desire as well as her own. Eh? Come! you'll ask her, won't you?

OCTAVIUS
(with sad gaiety)
At all events I promise you I shall never ask anyone else.

RAMSDEN
Oh, you shan't need to. She'll accept you, my boy-- although 
(here be suddenly becomes very serious indeed)
you have one great drawback.

OCTAVIUS
(anxiously)
What drawback is that, Mr Ramsden? I should rather say which of my many drawbacks?

RAMSDEN
I'll tell you, Octavius. 
(He takes from the table a book bound in red cloth)
I have in my hand a copy of the most infamous, the most scandalous, the most mischievous, the most blackguardly book that ever escaped burning at the hands of the common hangman. I have not read it: I would not soil my mind with such filth; but I have read what the papers say of it. The title is quite enough for me. 
(He reads it)
The Revolutionist's Handbook and Pocket Companion by John Tanner, M.I.R.C., Member of the Idle Rich Class.

OCTAVIUS
(smiling)
But Jack--

RAMSDEN
(testily)
For goodness' sake, don't call him Jack under my roof 
(he throws the book violently down on the table, Then, somewhat relieved, he comes past the table to Octavius, and addresses him at close quarters with impressive gravity)
Now, Octavius, I know that my dead friend was right when he said you were a generous lad. I know that this man was your schoolfellow, and that you feel bound to stand by him because there was a boyish friendship between you. But I ask you to consider the altered circumstances. You were treated as a son in my friend's house. You lived there; and your friends could not be turned from the door. This Tanner was in and out there on your account almost from his childhood. He addresses Annie by her Christian name as freely as you do. Well, while her father was alive, that was her father's business, not mine. This man Tanner was only a boy to him: his opinions were something to be laughed at, like a man's hat on a child's head. But now Tanner is a grown man and Annie a grown woman. And her father is gone. We don't as yet know the exact terms of his will; but he often talked it over with me; and I have no more doubt than I have that you're sitting there that the will appoints me Annie's trustee and guardian. 
(Forcibly)
Now I tell you, once for all, I can't and I won't have Annie placed in such a position that she must, out of regard for you, suffer the intimacy of this fellow Tanner. It's not fair: it's not right: it's not kind. What are you going to do about it?

OCTAVIUS
But Ann herself has told Jack that whatever his opinions are, he will always be welcome because he knew her dear father.

RAMSDEN
(out of patience)
That girl's mad about her duty to her parents. 
(He starts off like a goaded ox in the direction of John Bright, in whose expression there is no sympathy for him. As he speaks, he fumes down to Herbert Spencer, who receives him still more coldly)
Excuse me, Octavius; but there are limits to social toleration. You know that I am not a bigoted or prejudiced man. You know that I am plain Roebuck Ramsden when other men who have done less have got handles to their names, because I have stood for equality and liberty of conscience while they were truckling to the Church and to the aristocracy. Whitefield and I lost chance after chance through our advanced opinions. But I draw the line at Anarchism and Free Love and that sort of thing. If I am to be Annie's guardian, she will have to learn that she has a duty to me. I won't have it: I will not have it. She must forbid John Tanner the house; and so must you.

SD: The parlormaid returns.

OCTAVIUS
But--

RAMSDEN
(calling his attention to the servant)
Ssh! Well?

THE MAID
Mr Tanner wishes to see you, sir.

RAMSDEN
Mr Tanner!

OCTAVIUS
Jack!

RAMSDEN
How dare Mr Tanner call on me! Say I cannot see him.

OCTAVIUS
(hurt)
I am sorry you are turning my friend from your door like that.

THE MAID
(calmly)
He's not at the door, sir. He's upstairs in the drawingroom with Miss Ramsden. He came with Mrs Whitefield and Miss Ann and Miss Robinson, sir.

SD: Ramsden's feelings are beyond words.

OCTAVIUS
(grinning)
That's very like Jack, Mr Ramsden. You must see him, even if it's only to turn him out.

RAMSDEN
(hammering out his words with suppressed fury)
Go upstairs and ask Mr Tanner to be good enough to step down here. 
(The parlormaid goes out; and Ramsden returns to the fireplace, as to a fortified position)
I must say that of all the confounded pieces of impertinence--well, if these are Anarchist manners I hope you like them. And Annie with him! Annie! A-- 
(he chokes)


OCTAVIUS
Yes: that's what surprises me. He's so desperately afraid of Ann. There must be something the matter.

SD: Mr John Tanner suddenly opens the door and enters.

TANNER
Ramsden: do you know what that is?

RAMSDEN
(loftily)
No, Sir.

TANNER
It's a copy of Whitefield's will. Ann got it this morning.

RAMSDEN
When you say Ann, you mean, I presume, Miss Whitefield.

TANNER
I mean our Ann, your Ann, Tavy's Ann, and now, Heaven help me, my Ann!

OCTAVIUS
(rising, very pale)
What do you mean?

TANNER
Mean! 
(He holds up the will)
Do you know who is appointed Ann's guardian by this will?

RAMSDEN
(coolly)
I believe I am.

TANNER
You! You and I, man. I! I!! I!!! Both of us! 
(He flings the will down on the writing table)


RAMSDEN
You! Impossible.

TANNER
It's only too hideously true. 
(He throws himself into Octavius's chair)
Ramsden: get me out of it somehow. You don't know Ann as well as I do. She'll commit every crime a respectable woman can; and she'll justify every one of them by saying that it was the wish of her guardians. She'll put everything on us; and we shall have no more control over her than a couple of mice over a cat.

OCTAVIUS
Jack: I wish you wouldn't talk like that about Ann.

TANNER
This chap's in love with her: that's another complication. Well, she'll either jilt him and say I didn't approve of him, or marry him and say you ordered her to. I tell you, this is the most staggering blow that has ever fallen on a man of my age and temperament.

RAMSDEN
Let me see that will, sir. 
(He goes to the writing table and picks it up)
I cannot believe that my old friend Whitefield would have shown such a want of confidence in me as to associate me with-- 
(His countenance falls as he reads)


TANNER
It's all my own doing: that's the horrible irony of it. He told me one day that you were to be Ann's guardian; and like a fool I began arguing with him about the folly of leaving a young woman under the control of an old man with obsolete ideas.

RAMSDEN
(stupended)
My ideas obsolete!!!!!

TANNER
Totally. I had just finished an essay called Down with Government by the Greyhaired; and I was full of arguments and illustrations. I said the proper thing was to combine the experience of an old hand with the vitality of a young one. Hang me if he didn't take me at my word and alter his will--it's dated only a fortnight after that conversation--appointing me as joint guardian with you!

RAMSDEN
(pale and determined)
I shall refuse to act.

TANNER
What's the good of that? I've been refusing all the way from Richmond; but Ann keeps on saying that of course she's only an orphan; and that she can't expect the people who were glad to come to the house in her father's time to trouble much about her now. That's the latest game. An orphan! It's like hearing an ironclad talk about being at the mercy of the winds and waves.

OCTAVIUS
This is not fair, Jack. She is an orphan. And you ought to stand by her.

TANNER
Stand by her! What danger is she in? She has the law on her side; she has popular sentiment on her side; she has plenty of money and no conscience. All she wants with me is to load up all her moral responsibilities on me, and do as she likes at the expense of my character. I can't control her; and she can compromise me as much as she likes. I might as well be her husband.

RAMSDEN
You can refuse to accept the guardianship. I shall certainly refuse to hold it jointly with you.

TANNER
Yes; and what will she say to that? what does she say to it? Just that her father's wishes are sacred to her, and that she shall always look up to me as her guardian whether I care to face the responsibility or not. Refuse! You might as well refuse to accept the embraces of a boa constrictor when once it gets round your neck.

OCTAVIUS
This sort of talk is not kind to me, Jack.

TANNER
(rising and going to Octavius to console him, but still lamenting)
If he wanted a young guardian, why didn't he appoint Tavy?

RAMSDEN
Ah! why indeed?

OCTAVIUS
I will tell you. He sounded me about it; but I refused the trust because I loved her. I had no right to let myself be forced on her as a guardian by her father. He spoke to her about it; and she said I was right. You know I love her, Mr Ramsden; and Jack knows it too. If Jack loved a woman, I would not compare her to a boa constrictor in his presence, however much I might dislike her 
(he sits down between the busts and turns his face to the wall)


RAMSDEN
I do not believe that Whitefield was in his right senses when he made that will. You have admitted that he made it under your influence.

TANNER
You ought to be pretty well obliged to me for my influence. He leaves you two thousand five hundred for your trouble. He leaves Tavy a dowry for his sister and five thousand for himself.

OCTAVIUS
(his tears flowing afresh)
Oh, I can't take it. He was too good to us.

TANNER
You won't get it, my boy, if Ramsden upsets the will.

RAMSDEN
Ha! I see. You have got me in a cleft stick.

TANNER
He leaves me nothing but the charge of Ann's morals, on the ground that I have already more money than is good for me. That shows that he had his wits about him, doesn't it?

RAMSDEN
(grimly)
I admit that.

OCTAVIUS
(rising and coming from his refuge by the wall)
Mr Ramsden: I think you are prejudiced against Jack. He is a man of honor, and incapable of abusing--

TANNER
Don't, Tavy: you'll make me ill. I am not a man of honor: I am a man struck down by a dead hand. Tavy: you must marry her after all and take her off my hands. And I had set my heart on saving you from her!

OCTAVIUS
Oh, Jack, you talk of saving me from my highest happiness.

TANNER
Yes, a lifetime of happiness. If it were only the first half hour's happiness, Tavy, I would buy it for you with my last penny. But a lifetime of happiness! No man alive could bear it: it would be hell on earth.

RAMSDEN
(violently)
Stuff, sir. Talk sense; or else go and waste someone else's time: I have something better to do than listen to your fooleries 
(he positively kicks his way to his table and resumes his seat)


TANNER
You hear him, Tavy! Not an idea in his head later than eighteen-sixty. We can't leave Ann with no other guardian to turn to.

RAMSDEN
I am proud of your contempt for my character and opinions, sir. Your own are set forth in that book, I believe.

TANNER
(eagerly going to the table)
What! You've got my book! What do you think of it?

RAMSDEN
Do you suppose I would read such a book, sir?

TANNER
Then why did you buy it?

RAMSDEN
I did not buy it, sir. It has been sent me by some foolish lady who seems to admire your views. I was about to dispose of it when Octavius interrupted me. I shall do so now, with your permission. 
(He throws the book into the waste paper basket with such vehemence that Tanner recoils under the impression that it is being thrown at his head)


TANNER
You have no more manners than I have myself. However, that saves ceremony between us. 
(He sits down again)
What do you intend to do about this will?

OCTAVIUS
May I make a suggestion?

RAMSDEN
Certainly, Octavius.

OCTAVIUS
Aren't we forgetting that Ann herself may have some wishes in this matter?

RAMSDEN
I quite intend that Annie's wishes shall be consulted in every reasonable way. But she is only a woman, and a young and inexperienced woman at that.

TANNER
Ramsden: I begin to pity you.

RAMSDEN
(hotly)
I don't want to know how you feel towards me, Mr Tanner.

TANNER
Ann will do just exactly what she likes. And what's more, she'll force us to advise her to do it; and she'll put the blame on us if it turns out badly. So, as Tavy is longing to see her--

OCTAVIUS
(shyly)
I am not, Jack.

TANNER
You lie, Tavy: you are. So let's have her down from the drawing-room and ask her what she intends us to do. Off with you, Tavy, and fetch her. 
(Tavy turns to go)
And don't be long for the strained relations between myself and Ramsden will make the interval rather painful 
(Ramsden compresses his lips, but says nothing--)


OCTAVIUS
Never mind him, Mr Ramsden. He's not serious. 
(He goes out)


RAMSDEN
(very deliberately)
Mr Tanner: you are the most impudent person I have ever met.

TANNER
(seriously)
I know it, Ramsden. Yet even I cannot wholly conquer shame. We live in an atmosphere of shame. We are ashamed of everything that is real about us; ashamed of ourselves, of our relatives, of our incomes, of our accents, of our opinions, of our experience, just as we are ashamed of our naked skins. Good Lord, my dear Ramsden, we are ashamed to walk, ashamed to ride in an omnibus, ashamed to hire a hansom instead of keeping a carriage, ashamed of keeping one horse instead of two and a groom-gardener instead of a coachman and footman. The more things a man is ashamed of, the more respectable he is. Why, you're ashamed to buy my book, ashamed to read it: the only thing you're not ashamed of is to judge me for it without having read it; and even that only means that you're ashamed to have heterodox opinions. Look at the effect I produce because my fairy godmother withheld from me this gift of shame. I have every possible virtue that a man can have except--

RAMSDEN
I am glad you think so well of yourself.

TANNER
All you mean by that is that you think I ought to be ashamed of talking about my virtues. You don't mean that I haven't got them: you know perfectly well that I am as sober and honest a citizen as yourself, as truthful personally, and much more truthful politically and morally.

RAMSDEN
(touched on his most sensitive point)
I deny that. I will not allow you or any man to treat me as if I were a mere member of the British public. I detest its prejudices; I scorn its narrowness; I demand the right to think for myself. You pose as an advanced man. Let me tell you that I was an advanced man before you were born.

TANNER
I knew it was a long time ago.

RAMSDEN
I am as advanced as ever I was. I defy you to prove that I have ever hauled down the flag. I am more advanced than ever I was. I grow more advanced every day.

TANNER
More advanced in years, Polonius.

RAMSDEN
Polonius! So you are Hamlet, I suppose.

TANNER
No: I am only the most impudent person you've ever met. That's your notion of a thoroughly bad character. When you want to give me a piece of your mind, you ask yourself, as a just and upright man, what is the worst you can fairly say of me. Thief, liar, forger, adulterer, perjurer, glutton, drunkard? Not one of these names fit me. You have to fall back on my deficiency in shame. Well, I admit it. I even congratulate myself; for if I were ashamed of my real self, I should cut as stupid a figure as any of the rest of you. Cultivate a little impudence, Ramsden; and you will become quite a remarkable man.

RAMSDEN
I have no--

TANNER
You have no desire for that sort of notoriety. Bless you, I knew that answer would come as well as I know that a box of matches will come out of an automatic machine when I put a penny in the slot: you would be ashamed to say anything else.

SD: The crushing retort for which Ramsden has been visibly collecting his forces is lost for ever; for at this point Octavius returns with Miss Ann Whitefield and her mother; and Ramsden springs up and hurries to the door to receive them.

RAMSDEN
I am sorry, Annie, to force business on you at a sad time like the present. But your poor dear father's will has raised a very serious question. You have read it, I believe?

(Ann assents with a nod and a catch of her breath, too much affected to speak)


I must say I am surprised to find Mr Tanner named as joint guardian and trustee with myself of you and Rhoda. 
(A pause. They all look portentous; but they have nothing to say. Ramsden, a little ruffled by the lack of any response, continues)
I don't know that I can consent to act under such conditions. Mr Tanner has, I understand, some objection also; but I do not profess to understand its nature: he will no doubt speak for himself. But we are agreed that we can decide nothing until we know your views. I am afraid I shall have to ask you to choose between my sole guardianship and that of Mr Tanner; for I fear it is impossible for us to undertake a joint arrangement.

ANN
(in a low musical voice)
Mamma--

MRS WHITEFIELD
(hastily)
Now, Ann, I do beg you not to put it on me. I have no opinion on the subject; and if I had, it would probably not be attended to. I am quite with whatever you three think best.

SD: Tanner turns his head and looks fixedly at Ramsden, who angrily refuses to receive this mute communication.

ANN
(resuming in the same gentle voice, ignoring her mother's bad taste)
Mamma knows that she is not strong enough to bear the whole responsibility for me and Rhoda without some help and advice. Rhoda must have a guardian; and though I am older, I do not think any young unmarried woman should be left quite to her own guidance. I hope you agree with me, Granny?

TANNER
(starting)
Granny! Do you intend to call your guardians Granny?

ANN
Don't be foolish, Jack. Mr Ramsden has always been Grandpapa Roebuck to me: I am Granny's Annie; and he is Annie's Granny. I christened him so when I first learned to speak.

RAMSDEN
(sarcastically)
I hope you are satisfied, Mr Tanner. Go on, Annie: I quite agree with you.

ANN
Well, if I am to have a guardian, CAN I set aside anybody whom my dear father appointed for me?

RAMSDEN
(biting his lip)
You approve of your father's choice, then?

ANN
It is not for me to approve or disapprove. I accept it. My father loved me and knew best what was good for me.

RAMSDEN
Of course I understand your feeling, Annie. It is what I should have expected of you; and it does you credit. But it does not settle the question so completely as you think. Let me put a case to you. Suppose you were to discover that I had been guilty of some disgraceful action--that I was not the man your poor dear father took me for. Would you still consider it right that I should be Rhoda's guardian?

ANN
I can't imagine you doing anything disgraceful, Granny.

TANNER
(to Ramsden)
You haven't done anything of the sort, have you?

RAMSDEN
(indignantly)
No sir.

MRS. WHITEFIELD
(placidly)
Well, then, why suppose it?

ANN
You see, Granny, Mamma would not like me to suppose it.

RAMSDEN
(much perplexed)
You are both so full of natural and affectionate feeling in these family matters that it is very hard to put the situation fairly before you.

TANNER
Besides, my friend, you are not putting the situation fairly before them.

RAMSDEN
(sulkily)
Put it yourself, then.

TANNER
I will. Ann: Ramsden thinks I am not fit be your guardian; and I quite agree with him. He considers that if your father had read my book, he wouldn't have appointed me. That book is the disgraceful action he has been talking about. He thinks it's your duty for Rhoda's sake to ask him to act alone and to make me withdraw. Say the word and I will.

ANN
But I haven't read your book, Jack.

TANNER
(diving at the waste-paper basket and fishing the book out for her)
Then read it at once and decide.

RAMSDEN
If I am to be your guardian, I positively forbid you to read that book, Annie. 
(He smites the table with his fist and rises)


ANN
Of course, if you don't wish it. 
(She puts the book on the table)


TANNER
If one guardian is to forbid you to read the other guardian's book, how are we to settle it? Suppose I order you to read it! What about your duty to me?

ANN
(gently)
I am sure you would never purposely force me into a painful dilemma, Jack.

RAMSDEN
(irritably)
Yes, yes, Annie: this is all very well, and, as I said, quite natural and becoming. But you must make a choice one way or the other. We are as much in a dilemma as you.

ANN
I feel that I am too young, too inexperienced, to decide. My father's wishes are sacred to me.

MRS WHITEFIELD
If you two men won't carry them out I must say it is rather hard that you should put the responsibility on Ann. It seems to me that people are always putting things on other people in this world.

RAMSDEN
I am sorry you take it that way.

ANN
(touchingly)
Do you refuse to accept me as your ward, Granny?

RAMSDEN
No: I never said that. I greatly object to act with Mr Tanner: that's all.

MRS. WHITEFIELD
Why? What's the matter with poor Jack?

TANNER
My views are too advanced for him.

RAMSDEN
(indignantly)
They are not. I deny it.

ANN
Of course not. What nonsense! Nobody is more advanced than Granny. I am sure it is Jack himself who has made all the difficulty. Come, Jack! Be kind to me in my sorrow. You don't refuse to accept me as your ward, do you?

TANNER
(gloomily)
No. I let myself in for it; so I suppose I must face it. 
(He turns away to the bookcase, and stands there, moodily studying the titles of the volumes)


ANN
(rising and expanding with subdued but gushing delight)
Then we are all agreed; and my dear father's will is to be carried out. You don't know what a joy that is to me and to my mother! 
(She goes to Ramsden and presses both his hands, saying)
And I shall have my dear Granny to help and advise me. 
(She casts a glance at Tanner over her shoulder)
And Jack the Giant Killer. 
(She goes past her mother to Octavius)
And Jack's inseparable friend Ricky-ticky-tavy 
(he blushes and looks inexpressibly foolish)


MRS WHITEFIELD
(rising and shaking her widow's weeds straight)
Now that you are Ann's guardian, Mr Ramsden, I wish you would speak to her about her habit of giving people nicknames. They can't be expected to like it. 
(She moves towards the door)


ANN
How can you say such a thing, Mamma! 
(Glowing with affectionate remorse)
Oh, I wonder can you be right! Have I been inconsiderate? 
(She turns to Octavius, who is sitting astride his chair with his elbows on the back of it. Putting her hand on his forehead the turns his face up suddenly)
Do you want to be treated like a grown up man? Must I call you Mr Robinson in future?

OCTAVIUS
(earnestly)
Oh please call me Ricky-ticky--tavy, "Mr Robinson" would hurt me cruelly.

SD: She laughs and pats his cheek with her finger; then comes back to Ramsden

ANN
You know I'm beginning to think that Granny is rather a piece of impertinence. But I never dreamt of its hurting you.

RAMSDEN
(breezily, as he pats her affectionately on the back)
My dear Annie, nonsense. I insist on Granny. I won't answer to any other name than Annie's Granny.

ANN
(gratefully)
You all spoil me, except Jack.

TANNER
(over his shoulder, from the bookcase)
I think you ought to call me Mr Tanner.

ANN
(gently)
No you don't, Jack. That's like the things you say on purpose to shock people: those who know you pay no attention to them. But, if you like, I'll call you after your famous ancestor Don Juan.

RAMSDEN
Don Juan!

ANN
(innocently)
Oh, is there any harm in it? I didn't know. Then I certainly won't call you that. May I call you Jack until I can think of something else?

TANNER
Oh, for Heaven's sake don't try to invent anything worse. I capitulate. I consent to Jack. I embrace Jack. Here endeth my first and last attempt to assert my authority.

ANN
You see, Mamma, they all really like to have pet names.

MRS WHITEFIELD
Well, I think you might at least drop them until we are out of mourning.

ANN
(reproachfully, stricken to the soul)
Oh, how could you remind me, mother? 
(She hastily leaves the room to conceal her emotion)


MRS WHITEFIELD
Of course. My fault as usual! 
(She follows Ann)


TANNER
(coming from the bockcase)
Ramsden: we're beaten-- smashed--nonentitized, like her mother.

RAMSDEN
Stuff, Sir. 
(He follows Mrs Whitefield out of the room)


TANNER
(left alone with Octavius, stares whimsically at him)
Tavy: do you want to count for something in the world?

OCTAVIUS
I want to count for something as a poet: I want to write a great play.

TANNER
With Ann as the heroine?

OCTAVIUS
Yes: I confess it.

TANNER
Take care, Tavy. The play with Ann as the heroine is all right; but if you're not very careful, by Heaven she'll marry you.

OCTAVIUS
(sighing)
No such luck, Jack!

TANNER
Why, man, your head is in the lioness's mouth: you are half swallowed already--in three bites--Bite One, Ricky; Bite Two, Ticky; Bite Three, Tavy; and down you go.

OCTAVIUS
She is the same to everybody, Jack: you know her ways.

TANNER
Yes: she breaks everybody's back with the stroke of her paw; but the question is, which of us will she eat? My own opinion is that she means to eat you.

OCTAVIUS
(rising, pettishly)
It's horrible to talk like that about her when she is upstairs crying for her father. But I do so want her to eat me that I can bear your brutalities because they give me hope.

TANNER
Tavy; that's the devilish side of a woman's fascination: she makes you will your own destruction.

OCTAVIUS
But it's not destruction: it's fulfilment.

TANNER
Yes, of HER purpose; and that purpose is neither her happiness nor yours, but Nature's. Vitality in a woman is a blind fury of creation. She sacrifices herself to it: do you think she will hesitate to sacrifice you?

OCTAVIUS
Why, it is just because she is self-sacrificing that she will not sacrifice those she loves.

TANNER
That is the profoundest of mistakes, Tavy. It is the self-sacrificing women that sacrifice others most recklessly. Because they are unselfish, they are kind in little things. Because they have a purpose which is not their own purpose, but that of the whole universe, a man is nothing to them but an instrument of that purpose.

OCTAVIUS
Don't be ungenerous, Jack. They take the tenderest care of us.

TANNER
Yes, as a soldier takes care of his rifle or a musician of his violin. But do they allow us any purpose or freedom of our own? Will they lend us to one another? Can the strongest man escape from them when once he is appropriated? They tremble when we are in danger, and weep when we die; but the tears are not for us, but for a father wasted, a son's breeding thrown away. They accuse us of treating them as a mere means to our pleasure; but how can so feeble and transient a folly as a man's selfish pleasure enslave a woman as the whole purpose of Nature embodied in a woman can enslave a man?

OCTAVIUS
What matter, if the slavery makes us happy?

TANNER
No matter at all if you have no purpose of your own, and are, like most men, a mere breadwinner. But you, Tavy, are an artist: that is, you have a purpose as absorbing and as unscrupulous as a woman's purpose.

OCTAVIUS
Not unscrupulous.

TANNER
Quite unscrupulous. The true artist will let his wife starve, his children go barefoot, his mother drudge for his living at seventy, sooner than work at anything but his art. To women he is half vivisector, half vampire. He gets into intimate relations with them to study them, to strip the mask of convention from them, to surprise their inmost secrets, knowing that they have the power to rouse his deepest creative energies, to rescue him from his cold reason, to make him see visions and dream dreams, to inspire him, as he calls it. He persuades women that they may do this for their own purpose whilst he really means
