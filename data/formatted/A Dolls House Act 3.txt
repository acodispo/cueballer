NS: Act 3, Scene 1

SL: As Act 1. The table has been placed in the middle of the stage, with chairs around it. A lamp is burning on the table. The door into the hall stands open. Dance music is heard in the room above.

SD: Mrs. LINDE is sitting at the table idly turning over the leaves of a book; she tries to read, but does not seem able to collect her thoughts. Every now and then she listens intently for a sound at the outer door.

MRS. LINDE
[looking at her watch]
Not yet--and the time is nearly up. If only he does not--.
[Listens again.]
Ah, there he is.
[Goes into the hall and opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the stairs. She whispers.]
Come in. There is no one here.

KROGSTAD
[in the doorway]
I found a note from you at home. What does this mean?

MRS. LINDE
It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.

KROGSTAD
Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?

MRS. LINDE
It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers are at the dance upstairs.

KROGSTAD
[coming into the room]
Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?

MRS. LINDE
Yes, why not?

KROGSTAD
Certainly--why not?

MRS. LINDE
Now, Nils, let us have a talk.

KROGSTAD
Can we two have anything to talk about?

MRS. LINDE
We have a great deal to talk about.

KROGSTAD
I shouldn't have thought so.

MRS. LINDE
No, you have never properly understood me.

KROGSTAD
Was there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all the world--a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance turns up?

MRS. LINDE
Do you believe I am as absolutely heartless as all that? And do you believe that I did it with a light heart?

KROGSTAD
Didn't you?

MRS. LINDE
Nils, did you really think that?

KROGSTAD
If it were as you say, why did you write to me as you did at the time?

MRS. LINDE
I could do nothing else. As I had to break with you, it was my duty also to put an end to all that you felt for me.

KROGSTAD
[wringing his hands]
So that was it. And all this--only for the sake of money!

MRS. LINDE
You must not forget that I had a helpless mother and two little brothers. We couldn't wait for you, Nils; your prospects seemed hopeless then.

KROGSTAD
That may be so, but you had no right to throw me over for anyone else's sake.

MRS. LINDE
Indeed I don't know. Many a time did I ask myself if I had the right to do it.

KROGSTAD
[more gently]
When I lost you, it was as if all the solid ground went from under my feet. Look at me now--I am a shipwrecked man clinging to a bit of wreckage.

MRS. LINDE
But help may be near.

KROGSTAD
It was near; but then you came and stood in my way.

MRS. LINDE
Unintentionally, Nils. It was only today that I learned it was your place I was going to take in the Bank.

KROGSTAD
I believe you, if you say so. But now that you know it, are you not going to give it up to me?

MRS. LINDE
No, because that would not benefit you in the least.

KROGSTAD
Oh, benefit, benefit--I would have done it whether or no.

MRS. LINDE
I have learned to act prudently. Life, and hard, bitter necessity have taught me that.

KROGSTAD
And life has taught me not to believe in fine speeches.

MRS. LINDE
Then life has taught you something very reasonable. But deeds you must believe in?

KROGSTAD
What do you mean by that?

MRS. LINDE
You said you were like a shipwrecked man clinging to some wreckage.

KROGSTAD
I had good reason to say so.

MRS. LINDE
Well, I am like a shipwrecked woman clinging to some wreckage--no one to mourn for, no one to care for.

KROGSTAD
It was your own choice.

MRS. LINDE
There was no other choice--then.

KROGSTAD
Well, what now?

MRS. LINDE
Nils, how would it be if we two shipwrecked people could join forces?

KROGSTAD
What are you saying?

MRS. LINDE
Two on the same piece of wreckage would stand a better chance than each on their own.

KROGSTAD
Christine, I...

MRS. LINDE
What do you suppose brought me to town?

KROGSTAD
Do you mean that you gave me a thought?

MRS. LINDE
I could not endure life without work. All my life, as long as I can remember, I have worked, and it has been my greatest and only pleasure. But now I am quite alone in the world--my life is so dreadfully empty and I feel so forsaken. There is not the least pleasure in working for one's self. Nils, give me someone and something to work for.

KROGSTAD
I don't trust that. It is nothing but a woman's overstrained sense of generosity that prompts you to make such an offer of yourself.

MRS. LINDE
Have you ever noticed anything of the sort in me?

KROGSTAD
Could you really do it? Tell me--do you know all about my past life?

MRS. LINDE
Yes.

KROGSTAD
And do you know what they think of me here?

MRS. LINDE
You seemed to me to imply that with me you might have been quite another man.

KROGSTAD
I am certain of it.

MRS. LINDE
Is it too late now?

KROGSTAD
Christine, are you saying this deliberately? Yes, I am sure you are. I see it in your face. Have you really the courage, then--?

MRS. LINDE
I want to be a mother to someone, and your children need a mother. We two need each other. Nils, I have faith in your real character--I can dare anything together with you.

KROGSTAD
[grasps her hands]
Thanks, thanks, Christine! Now I shall find a way to clear myself in the eyes of the world. Ah, but I forgot--

MRS. LINDE
[listening]
Hush! The Tarantella! Go, go!

KROGSTAD
Why? What is it?

MRS. LINDE
Do you hear them up there? When that is over, we may expect them back.

KROGSTAD
Yes, yes--I will go. But it is all no use. Of course you are not aware what steps I have taken in the matter of the Helmers.

MRS. LINDE
Yes, I know all about that.

KROGSTAD
And in spite of that have you the courage to--?

MRS. LINDE
I understand very well to what lengths a man like you might be driven by despair.

KROGSTAD
If I could only undo what I have done!

MRS. LINDE
You cannot. Your letter is lying in the letter-box now.

KROGSTAD
Are you sure of that?

MRS. LINDE
Quite sure, but--

KROGSTAD
[with a searching look at her]
Is that what it all means?--that you want to save your friend at any cost? Tell me frankly. Is that it?

MRS. LINDE
Nils, a woman who has once sold herself for another's sake, doesn't do it a second time.

KROGSTAD
I will ask for my letter back.

MRS. LINDE
No, no.

KROGSTAD
Yes, of course I will. I will wait here until Helmer comes; I will tell him he must give me my letter back--that it only concerns my dismissal--that he is not to read it--

MRS. LINDE
No, Nils, you must not recall your letter.

KROGSTAD
But, tell me, wasn't it for that very purpose that you asked me to meet you here?

MRS. LINDE
In my first moment of fright, it was. But twenty-four hours have elapsed since then, and in that time I have witnessed incredible things in this house. Helmer must know all about it. This unhappy secret must be disclosed; they must have a complete understanding between them, which is impossible with all this concealment and falsehood going on.

KROGSTAD
Very well, if you will take the responsibility. But there is one thing I can do in any case, and I shall do it at once.

MRS. LINDE
[listening]
You must be quick and go! The dance is over; we are not safe a moment longer.

KROGSTAD
I will wait for you below.

MRS. LINDE
Yes, do. You must see me back to my door...

KROGSTAD
I have never had such an amazing piece of good fortune in my life!

SD: [Goes out through the outer door. The door between the room and the hall remains open.]

MRS. LINDE
[tidying up the room and laying her hat and cloak ready]
What a difference! what a difference! Someone to work for and live for--a home to bring comfort into. That I will do, indeed. I wish they would be quick and come--
[Listens.]
Ah, there they are now. I must put on my things.
[Takes up her hat and cloak. HELMER'S and NORA'S voices are heard outside; a key is turned, and HELMER brings NORA almost by force into the hall. She is in an Italian costume with a large black shawl around her; he is in evening dress, and a black domino which is flying open.]

NORA
[hanging back in the doorway, and struggling with him]
No, no, no!--don't take me in. I want to go upstairs again; I don't want to leave so early.

HELMER
But, my dearest Nora--

NORA
Please, Torvald dear--please, please--only an hour more.

HELMER
Not a single minute, my sweet Nora. You know that was our agreement. Come along into the room; you are catching cold standing there.

SD: [He brings her gently into the room, in spite of her resistance.]

MRS. LINDE
Good evening.

NORA
Christine!

HELMER
You here, so late, Mrs. Linde?

MRS. LINDE
Yes, you must excuse me; I was so anxious to see Nora in her dress.

NORA
Have you been sitting here waiting for me?

MRS. LINDE
Yes, unfortunately I came too late, you had already gone upstairs; and I thought I couldn't go away again without having seen you.

HELMER
[taking off NORA'S shawl]
Yes, take a good look at her. I think she is worth looking at. Isn't she charming, Mrs. Linde?

MRS. LINDE
Yes, indeed she is.

HELMER
Doesn't she look remarkably pretty? Everyone thought so at the dance. But she is terribly self-willed, this sweet little person. What are we to do with her? You will hardly believe that I had almost to bring her away by force.

NORA
Torvald, you will repent not having let me stay, even if it were only for half an hour.

HELMER
Listen to her, Mrs. Linde! She had danced her Tarantella, and it had been a tremendous success, as it deserved--although possibly the performance was a trifle too realistic--a little more so, I mean, than was strictly compatible with the limitations of art. But never mind about that! The chief thing is, she had made a success--she had made a tremendous success. Do you think I was going to let her remain there after that, and spoil the effect? No, indeed! I took my charming little Capri maiden--my capricious little Capri maiden, I should say--on my arm; took one quick turn round the room; a curtsey on either side, and, as they say in novels, the beautiful apparition disappeared. An exit ought always to be effective, Mrs. Linde; but that is what I cannot make Nora understand. Pooh! this room is hot.

SD: [Throws his domino on a chair, and opens the door of his room.]

HELMER
Hullo! it's all dark in here. Oh, of course--excuse me--.

SD: [He goes in, and lights some candles.]

NORA
[in a hurried and breathless whisper]
Well?

MRS. LINDE
[in a low voice]
I have had a talk with him.

NORA
Yes, and--

MRS. LINDE
Nora, you must tell your husband all about it.

NORA
[in an expressionless voice]
I knew it.

MRS. LINDE
You have nothing to be afraid of as far as Krogstad is concerned; but you must tell him.

NORA
I won't tell him.

MRS. LINDE
Then the letter will.

NORA
Thank you, Christine. Now I know what I must do. Hush--!

HELMER
[coming in again]
Well, Mrs. Linde, have you admired her?

MRS. LINDE
Yes, and now I will say goodnight.

HELMER
What, already? Is this yours, this knitting?

MRS. LINDE
[taking it]
Yes, thank you, I had very nearly forgotten it.

HELMER
So you knit?

MRS. LINDE
Of course.

HELMER
Do you know, you ought to embroider.

MRS. LINDE
Really? Why?

HELMER
Yes, it's far more becoming. Let me show you. You hold the embroidery thus in your left hand, and use the needle with the right--like this--with a long, easy sweep. Do you see?

MRS. LINDE
Yes, perhaps--

HELMER
But in the case of knitting--that can never be anything but ungraceful; look here--the arms close together, the knitting- needles going up and down--it has a sort of Chinese effect--. That was really excellent champagne they gave us.

MRS. LINDE
Well,--goodnight, Nora, and don't be self-willed any more.

HELMER
That's right, Mrs. Linde.

MRS. LINDE
Goodnight, Mr. Helmer.

HELMER
[accompanying her to the door]
Goodnight, goodnight. I hope you will get home all right. I should be very happy to--but you haven't any great distance to go. Goodnight, goodnight.

SD: [She goes out; he shuts the door after her, and comes in again.]

HELMER
Ah!--at last we have got rid of her. She is a frightful bore, that woman.

NORA
Aren't you very tired, Torvald?

HELMER
No, not in the least.

NORA
Nor sleepy?

HELMER
Not a bit. On the contrary, I feel extraordinarily lively. And you?--you really look both tired and sleepy.

NORA
Yes, I am very tired. I want to go to sleep at once.

HELMER
There, you see it was quite right of me not to let you stay there any longer.

NORA
Everything you do is quite right, Torvald.

HELMER
[kissing her on the forehead]
Now my little skylark is speaking reasonably. Did you notice what good spirits Rank was in this evening?

NORA
Really? Was he? I didn't speak to him at all.

HELMER
And I very little, but I have not for a long time seen him in such good form.

SD: [Looks for a while at her and then goes nearer to her.]

HELMER
It is delightful to be at home by ourselves again, to be all alone with you--you fascinating, charming little darling!

NORA
Don't look at me like that, Torvald.

HELMER
Why shouldn't I look at my dearest treasure?--at all the beauty that is mine, all my very own?

NORA
[going to the other side of the table]
You mustn't say things like that to me tonight.

HELMER
[following her]
You have still got the Tarantella in your blood, I see. And it makes you more captivating than ever. Listen--the guests are beginning to go now.

SD: [In a lower voice.]

HELMER
Nora--soon the whole house will be quiet.

NORA
Yes, I hope so.

HELMER
Yes, my own darling Nora. Do you know, when I am out at a party with you like this, why I speak so little to you, keep away from you, and only send a stolen glance in your direction now and then?--do you know why I do that? It is because I make believe to myself that we are secretly in love, and you are my secretly promised bride, and that no one suspects there is anything between us.

NORA
Yes, yes--I know very well your thoughts are with me all the time.

HELMER
And when we are leaving, and I am putting the shawl over your beautiful young shoulders--on your lovely neck--then I imagine that you are my young bride and that we have just come from the wedding, and I am bringing you for the first time into our home--to be alone with you for the first time--quite alone with my shy little darling! All this evening I have longed for nothing but you. When I watched the seductive figures of the Tarantella, my blood was on fire; I could endure it no longer, and that was why I brought you down so early--

NORA
Go away, Torvald! You must let me go. I won't--

HELMER
What's that? You're joking, my little Nora! You won't-- you won't? Am I not your husband--?

SD: [A knock is heard at the outer door.]

NORA
[starting]
Did you hear--?

HELMER
[going into the hall]
Who is it?

RANK
[outside]
It is I. May I come in for a moment?

HELMER
[in a fretful whisper]
Oh, what does he want now?

SD: [Aloud.]

HELMER
Wait a minute!

SD: [Unlocks the door.]

HELMER
Come, that's kind of you not to pass by our door.

RANK
I thought I heard your voice, and felt as if I should like to look in.

SD: [With a swift glance round.]

RANK
Ah, yes!--these dear familiar rooms. You are very happy and cosy in here, you two.

HELMER
It seems to me that you looked after yourself pretty well upstairs too.

RANK
Excellently. Why shouldn't I? Why shouldn't one enjoy everything in this world?--at any rate as much as one can, and as long as one can. The wine was capital--

HELMER
Especially the champagne.

RANK
So you noticed that too? It is almost incredible how much I managed to put away!

NORA
Torvald drank a great deal of champagne tonight too.

RANK
Did he?

NORA
Yes, and he is always in such good spirits afterwards.

RANK
Well, why should one not enjoy a merry evening after a well-spent day?

HELMER
Well spent? I am afraid I can't take credit for that.

RANK
[clapping him on the back]
But I can, you know!

NORA
Doctor Rank, you must have been occupied with some scientific investigation today.

RANK
Exactly.

HELMER
Just listen!--little Nora talking about scientific investigations!

NORA
And may I congratulate you on the result?

RANK
Indeed you may.

NORA
Was it favourable, then?

RANK
The best possible, for both doctor and patient--certainty.

NORA
[quickly and searchingly]
Certainty?

RANK
Absolute certainty. So wasn't I entitled to make a merry evening of it after that?

NORA
Yes, you certainly were, Doctor Rank. Helmer. I think so too, so long as you don't have to pay for it in the morning.

RANK
Oh well, one can't have anything in this life without paying for it.

NORA
Doctor Rank--are you fond of fancy-dress balls?

RANK
Yes, if there is a fine lot of pretty costumes.

NORA
Tell me--what shall we two wear at the next?

HELMER
Little featherbrain!--are you thinking of the next already?

RANK
We two? Yes, I can tell you. You shall go as a good fairy--

HELMER
Yes, but what do you suggest as an appropriate costume for that?

RANK
Let your wife go dressed just as she is in everyday life.

HELMER
That was really very prettily turned. But can't you tell us what you will be?

RANK
Yes, my dear friend, I have quite made up my mind about that.

HELMER
Well?

RANK
At the next fancy-dress ball I shall be invisible.

HELMER
That's a good joke!

RANK
There is a big black hat--have you never heard of hats that make you invisible? If you put one on, no one can see you.

HELMER
[suppressing a smile]
Yes, you are quite right.

RANK
But I am clean forgetting what I came for. Helmer, give me a cigar--one of the dark Havanas.

HELMER
With the greatest pleasure.

SD: [Offers him his case.]

RANK
[takes a cigar and cuts off the end]
Thanks.

NORA
[striking a match]
Let me give you a light.

RANK
Thank you.

SD: [She holds the match for him to light his cigar.]

RANK
And now goodbye!

HELMER
Goodbye, goodbye, dear old man!

NORA
Sleep well, Doctor Rank.

RANK
Thank you for that wish.

NORA
Wish me the same.

RANK
You? Well, if you want me to sleep well! And thanks for the light.

SD: [He nods to them both and goes out.]

HELMER
[in a subdued voice]
He has drunk more than he ought.

NORA
[absently]
Maybe.

SD: [HELMER takes a bunch of keys out of his pocket and goes into the hall.]

NORA
Torvald! what are you going to do there?

HELMER
Emptying the letter-box; it is quite full; there will be no room to put the newspaper in tomorrow morning.

NORA
Are you going to work tonight?

HELMER
You know quite well I'm not. What is this? Someone has been at the lock.

NORA
At the lock--?

HELMER
Yes, someone has. What can it mean? I should never have thought the maid--. Here is a broken hairpin. Nora, it is one of yours.

NORA
[quickly]
Then it must have been the children--

HELMER
Then you must get them out of those ways. There, at last I have got it open.

SD: [Takes out the contents of the letter-box, and calls to the kitchen.]

HELMER
Helen!--Helen, put out the light over the front door.

SD: [Goes back into the room and shuts the door into the hall. He holds out his hand full of letters.]

HELMER
Look at that-- look what a heap of them there are.

SD: [Turning them over.]

HELMER
What on earth is that?

NORA
[at the window]
The letter--No! Torvald, no!

HELMER
Two cards--of Rank's.

NORA
Of Doctor Rank's?

HELMER
[looking at them]
Doctor Rank. They were on the top. He must have put them in when he went out.

NORA
Is there anything written on them?

HELMER
There is a black cross over the name. Look there--what an uncomfortable idea! It looks as if he were announcing his own death.

NORA
It is just what he is doing.

HELMER
What? Do you know anything about it? Has he said anything to you?

NORA
Yes. He told me that when the cards came it would be his leave-taking from us. He means to shut himself up and die.

HELMER
My poor old friend! Certainly I knew we should not have him very long with us. But so soon! And so he hides himself away like a wounded animal.

NORA
If it has to happen, it is best it should be without a word--don't you think so, Torvald?

HELMER
[walking up and down]
He had so grown into our lives. I can't think of him as having gone out of them. He, with his sufferings and his loneliness, was like a cloudy background to our sunlit happiness. Well, perhaps it is best so. For him, anyway.

SD: [Standing still.]

HELMER
And perhaps for us too, Nora. We two are thrown quite upon each other now.

SD: [Puts his arms round her.]

HELMER
My darling wife, I don't feel as if I could hold you tight enough. Do you know, Nora, I have often wished that you might be threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life's blood, and everything, for your sake.

NORA
[disengages herself, and says firmly and decidedly]
Now you must read your letters, Torvald.

HELMER
No, no; not tonight. I want to be with you, my darling wife.

NORA
With the thought of your friend's death--

HELMER
You are right, it has affected us both. Something ugly has come between us--the thought of the horrors of death. We must try and rid our minds of that. Until then--we will each go to our own room.

NORA
[hanging on his neck]
Goodnight, Torvald--Goodnight!

HELMER
[kissing her on the forehead]
Goodnight, my little singing-bird. Sleep sound, Nora. Now I will read my letters through.

SD: [He takes his letters and goes into his room, shutting the door after him.]

NORA
[gropes distractedly about, seizes HELMER'S domino, throws it round her, while she says in quick, hoarse, spasmodic whispers]
Never to see him again. Never! Never!

SD: [Puts her shawl over her head.]

NORA
Never to see my children again either--never again. Never! Never!--Ah! the icy, black water--the unfathomable depths--If only it were over! He has got it now--now he is reading it. Goodbye, Torvald and my children!

SD: [She is about to rush out through the hall, when HELMER opens his door hurriedly and stands with an open letter in his hand.]

HELMER
Nora!

NORA
Ah!--

HELMER
What is this? Do you know what is in this letter?

NORA
Yes, I know. Let me go! Let me get out!

HELMER
[holding her back]
Where are you going?

NORA
[trying to get free]
You shan't save me, Torvald!

HELMER
[reeling]
True? Is this true, that I read here? Horrible! No, no--it is impossible that it can be true.

NORA
It is true. I have loved you above everything else in the world.

HELMER
Oh, don't let us have any silly excuses.

NORA
[taking a step towards him]
Torvald--!

HELMER
Miserable creature--what have you done?

NORA
Let me go. You shall not suffer for my sake. You shall not take it upon yourself.

HELMER
No tragic airs, please.

SD: [Locks the hall door.]

HELMER
Here you shall stay and give me an explanation. Do you understand what you have done? Answer me! Do you understand what you have done?

NORA
[looks steadily at him and says with a growing look of coldness in her face]
Yes, now I am beginning to understand thoroughly.

HELMER
[walking about the room]
What a horrible awakening! All these eight years--she who was my joy and pride--a hypocrite, a liar--worse, worse--a criminal! The unutterable ugliness of it all!--For shame! For shame!

SD: [NORA is silent and looks steadily at him. He stops in front of her.]

HELMER
I ought to have suspected that something of the sort would happen. I ought to have foreseen it. All your father's want of principle--be silent!--all your father's want of principle has come out in you. No religion, no morality, no sense of duty--. How I am punished for having winked at what he did! I did it for your sake, and this is how you repay me.

NORA
Yes, that's just it.

HELMER
Now you have destroyed all my happiness. You have ruined all my future. It is horrible to think of! I am in the power of an unscrupulous man; he can do what he likes with me, ask anything he likes of me, give me any orders he pleases--I dare not refuse. And I must sink to such miserable depths because of a thoughtless woman!

NORA
When I am out of the way, you will be free.

HELMER
No fine speeches, please. Your father had always plenty of those ready, too. What good would it be to me if you were out of the way, as you say? Not the slightest. He can make the affair known everywhere; and if he does, I may be falsely suspected of having been a party to your criminal action. Very likely people will think I was behind it all--that it was I who prompted you! And I have to thank you for all this--you whom I have cherished during the whole of our married life. Do you understand now what it is you have done for me?

NORA
[coldly and quietly]
Yes.

HELMER
It is so incredible that I can't take it in. But we must come to some understanding. Take off that shawl. Take it off, I tell you. I must try and appease him some way or another. The matter must be hushed up at any cost. And as for you and me, it must appear as if everything between us were just as before--but naturally only in the eyes of the world. You will still remain in my house, that is a matter of course. But I shall not allow you to bring up the children; I dare not trust them to you. To think that I should be obliged to say so to one whom I have loved so dearly, and whom I still--. No, that is all over. From this moment happiness is not the question; all that concerns us is to save the remains, the fragments, the appearance--

SD: [A ring is heard at the front-door bell.]

HELMER
[with a start]
What is that? So late! Can the worst--? Can he--? Hide yourself, Nora. Say you are ill.

SD: [NORA stands motionless. HELMER goes and unlocks the hall door.]

MAID
[half-dressed, comes to the door]
A letter for the mistress.

HELMER
Give it to me.

SD: [Takes the letter, and shuts the door.]

HELMER
Yes, it is from him. You shall not have it; I will read it myself.

NORA
Yes, read it.

HELMER
[standing by the lamp]
I scarcely have the courage to do it. It may mean ruin for both of us. No, I must know.

SD: [Tears open the letter, runs his eye over a few lines, looks at a paper enclosed, and gives a shout of joy.]

HELMER
Nora!

SD: [She looks at him questioningly.]

HELMER
Nora!--No, I must read it once again--. Yes, it is true! I am saved! Nora, I am saved!

NORA
And I?

HELMER
You too, of course; we are both saved, both you and I. Look, he sends you your bond back. He says he regrets and repents-- that a happy change in his life--never mind what he says! We are saved, Nora! No one can do anything to you. Oh, Nora, Nora!--no, first I must destroy these hateful things. Let me see--.

SD: [Takes a look at the bond.]

HELMER
No, no, I won't look at it. The whole thing shall be nothing but a bad dream to me.

SD: [Tears up the bond and both letters, throws them all into the stove, and watches them burn.]

HELMER
There--now it doesn't exist any longer. He says that since Christmas Eve you--. These must have been three dreadful days for you, Nora.

NORA
I have fought a hard fight these three days.

HELMER
And suffered agonies, and seen no way out but--. No, we won't call any of the horrors to mind. We will only shout with joy, and keep saying, "It's all over! It's all over!" Listen to me, Nora. You don't seem to realise that it is all over. What is this?--such a cold, set face! My poor little Nora, I quite understand; you don't feel as if you could believe that I have forgiven you. But it is true, Nora, I swear it; I have forgiven you everything. I know that what you did, you did out of love for me.

NORA
That is true.

HELMER
You have loved me as a wife ought to love her husband. Only you had not sufficient knowledge to judge of the means you used. But do you suppose you are any the less dear to me, because you don't understand how to act on your own responsibility? No, no; only lean on me; I will advise you and direct you. I should not be a man if this womanly helplessness did not just give you a double attractiveness in my eyes. You must not think anymore about the hard things I said in my first moment of consternation, when I thought everything was going to overwhelm me. I have forgiven you, Nora; I swear to you I have forgiven you.

NORA
Thank you for your forgiveness.

SD: [She goes out through the door to the right.]

HELMER
No, don't go--.

SD: [Looks in.]

HELMER
What are you doing in there?

NORA
[from within]
Taking off my fancy dress.

HELMER
[standing at the open door]
Yes, do. Try and calm yourself, and make your mind easy again, my frightened little singing-bird. Be at rest, and feel secure; I have broad wings to shelter you under.

SD: [Walks up and down by the door.]

HELMER
How warm and cosy our home is, Nora. Here is shelter for you; here I will protect you like a hunted dove that I have saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring peace to your poor beating heart. It will come, little by little, Nora, believe me. Tomorrow morning you will look upon it all quite differently; soon everything will be just as it was before. Very soon you won't need me to assure you that I have forgiven you; you will yourself feel the certainty that I have done so. Can you suppose I should ever think of such a thing as repudiating you, or even reproaching you? You have no idea what a true man's heart is like, Nora. There is something so indescribably sweet and satisfying, to a man, in the knowledge that he has forgiven his wife--forgiven her freely, and with all his heart. It seems as if that had made her, as it were, doubly his own; he has given her a new life, so to speak; and she has in a way become both wife and child to him. So you shall be for me after this, my little scared, helpless darling. Have no anxiety about anything, Nora; only be frank and open with me, and I will serve as will and conscience both to you--. What is this? Not gone to bed? Have you changed your things
