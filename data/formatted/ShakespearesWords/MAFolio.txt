NS: Act 1 Scene 1

SD: Enter +LEONATO Gouernour of Messina, +INNOGEN his wife, +HERO his daughter, and +BEATRICE his Neece, with a messenger.

+LEONATO
I Learne in this Letter, that Don Peter of Arragon,
comes this night to Messina.

+MESS
He is very neere by this: he was not three
Leagues off when I left him.

+LEONATO
How many Gentlemen haue you lost in this
action?

+MESS
But few of any sort, and none of name.

+LEONATO
A victorie is twice it selfe, when the atchieuer brings
home full numbers: I finde heere, that Don Peter hath
bestowed much honor on a yong Florentine, called
Claudio.

+MESS
Much deseru'd on his part, and equally remembred
by Don Pedro, he hath borne himselfe beyond
the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a
Lambe, the feats of a Lion, he hath indeede better bettred
expectation, then you must expect of me to tell you how.

+LEONATO
He hath an Vnckle heere in Messina, wil be very
much glad of it.

+MESS
I haue alreadie deliuered him letters, and
there appeares much ioy in him, euen so much, that ioy
could not shew it selfe modest enough, without a badg of
bitternesse.

+LEONATO
Did he breake out into teares?

+MESS
In great measure.

+LEONATO
A kinde ouerflow of kindnesse, there are no faces
truer, then those that are so wash'd, how much better is
it to weepe at ioy, then to ioy at weeping?

+BEATRICE
I pray you, is Signior Mountanto return'd from
the warres, or no?

+MESS
I know none of that name, Lady, there was
none such in the armie of any sort.

+LEONATO
What is he that you aske for Neece?

+HERO
My cousin meanes Signior Benedick of Padua

+MESS
O he's return'd, and as pleasant as euer he
was.

+BEATRICE
He set vp his bils here in Messina, & challeng'd
Cupid at the Flight: and my Vnckles foole reading
the Challenge, subscrib'd for Cupid, and challeng'd him
at the Burbolt. I pray you, how many hath hee kil'd and
eaten in these warres? But how many hath he kil'd? for
indeed, I promis'd to eate all of his killing.

+LEONATO
'Faith Neece, you taxe Signior Benedicke too much,
but hee'l be meet with you, I doubt it not.

+MESS
He hath done good seruice Lady in these
wars.

+BEATRICE
You had musty victuall, and he hath holpe to ease
it: he's a very valiant Trencher-man, hee hath an excellent
stomacke.

+MESS
And a good souldier too Lady.

+BEATRICE
And a good souldier to a Lady. But what is he to a
Lord?

+MESS
A Lord to a Lord, a man to a man, stuft with
all honourable vertues.

+BEATRICE
It is so indeed, he is no lesse then a stuft man:
but for the stuffing well, we are all mortall.

+LEONATO
You must not [sir] mistake my Neece, there is a
kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick, & her:
they neuer meet, but there's a skirmish of wit between
them.

+BEATRICE
Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict,
foure of his fiue wits went halting off, and now is the
whole man gouern'd with one: so that if hee haue wit
enough to keepe himselfe warme, let him beare it for a
difference betweene himselfe and his horse: For it is all the
wealth that he hath left, to be knowne a reasonable creature.
Who is his companion now? He hath euery month
a new sworne brother.

+MESS
I'st possible?

+BEATRICE
Very easily possible: he weares his faith but as
the fashion of his hat, it euer changes with ye next
block.

+MESS
I see [Lady] the Gentleman is not in your bookes.

+BEATRICE
No, and he were, I would burne my study. But
I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young
squarer now, that will make a voyage with him to the
diuell?

+MESS
He is most in the company of the right noble
Claudio.

+BEATRICE
O Lord, he will hang vpon him like a disease:
he is sooner caught then the pestilence, and the taker
runs presently mad. God helpe the noble Claudio, if hee
haue caught the Benedict, it will cost him a thousand
pound ere he be cur'd.

+MESS
I will hold friends with you Lady.

+BEATRICE
Do good friend.

+LEONATO
You'l ne're run mad Neece.

+BEATRICE
No, not till a hot Ianuary.

+MESS
Don Pedro is approach'd.
SD: Enter +DON PEDRO, +CLAUDIO, +BENEDICKE, +BALTHASAR, and +IOHN the bastard.

+PEDRO
Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet
your trouble: the fashion of the world is to auoid cost,
and you encounter it.

+LEONATO
Neuer came trouble to my house in the likenes
of your Grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
remaine: but when you depart from me, sorrow abides,
and happinesse takes his leaue.

+PEDRO
You embrace your charge too willingly: I
thinke this is your daughter.

+LEONATO
Her mother hath many times told me so.

+BENEDICKE
Were you in doubt that you askt her?

+LEONATO
Signior Benedicke, no, for then were you a childe.

+PEDRO
You haue it full Benedicke, we may ghesse by
this, what you are, being a man, truely the Lady fathers
her selfe: be happie Lady, for you are like an honorable
father.

+BENEDICKE
If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
haue his head on her shoulders for al Messina, as like
him as she is.

+BEATRICE
I wonder that you will still be talking, signior
Benedicke, no body markes you.

+BENEDICKE
What my deere Ladie Disdaine! are you yet
liuing?

+BEATRICE
Is it possible Disdaine should die, while shee hath
such meete foode to feede it, as Signior Benedicke? Curtesie
it selfe must conuert to Disdaine, if you come in her
presence.

+BENEDICKE
Then is curtesie a turne-coate, but it is certaine I
am loued of all Ladies, onely you excepted: and I would
I could finde in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for
truely I loue none.

+BEATRICE
A deere happinesse to women, they would else
haue beene troubled with a pernitious Suter, I thanke
God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that,
I had rather heare my Dog barke at a Crow, than a man sweare
he loues me.

+BENEDICKE
God keepe your Ladiship still in that minde,
so some Gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate
scratcht face.

+BEATRICE
Scratching could not make it worse, and 'twere
such a face as yours were.

+BENEDICKE
Well, you are a rare Parrat teacher.

+BEATRICE
A bird of my tongue, is better than a beast of
your.

+BENEDICKE
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue,
and so good a continuer, but keepe your way a Gods
name, I haue done.

+BEATRICE
You alwaies end with a Iades tricke, I know you
of old.

+PEDRO
This is the summe of all: Leonato, signior
Claudio, and signior Benedicke; my deere friend Leonato,
hath inuited you all, I tell him we shall stay here, at the
least a moneth, and he heartily praies some occasion may
detaine vs longer: I dare sweare hee is no hypocrite, but
praies from his heart.

+LEONATO
If you sweare, my Lord, you shall not be
forsworne, let mee bid you welcome, my
Lord, being reconciled to the Prince your brother: I owe
you all duetie.

+JOHN
I thanke you, I am not of many words, but I
thanke you.

+LEONATO
Please it your grace leade on?

+PEDRO
Your hand Leonato, we will goe together.
SD: Exeunt +LEONATO, +INNOGEN, +HERO, +BEATRICE, +MESSENGER, +PEDRO, +BALTHASAR, +JOHN. Manet +BENEDICKE and +CLAUDIO.

+CLAUDIO
Benedicke, didst thou note the daughter of signior
Leonato?

+BENEDICKE
I noted her not, but I lookt on her.

+CLAUDIO
Is she not a modest yong Ladie?

+BENEDICKE
Doe you question me as an honest man should
doe, for my simple true iudgement? or would you haue
me speake after my custome, as being a professed tyrant
to their sexe?

+CLAUDIO
No, I pray thee speake in sober iudgement.

+BENEDICKE
Why yfaith me thinks shee's too low for a
hie praise, too browne for a faire praise, and too little for
a great praise, onely this commendation I can affoord her,
that were shee other then she is, she were vnhandsome,
and being no other, but as she is, I doe not like her.

+CLAUDIO
Thou think'st I am in sport, I pray thee tell me
truely how thou lik'st her.

+BENEDICKE
Would you buie her, that you enquier after her?

+CLAUDIO
Can the world buie such a iewell?

+BENEDICKE
Yea, and a case to put it into, but speake you
this with a sad brow? Or doe you play the flowting iacke,
to tell vs Cupid is a good Hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare
Carpenter: Come, in what key shall a man take you to goe
in the song?

+CLAUDIO
In mine eie, she is the sweetest Ladie that euer I
lookt on.

+BENEDICKE
I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no
such matter: there's her cosin, and she were not possest
with a furie, exceedes her as much in beautie, as the
first of Maie doth the last of December: but I hope you
haue no intent to turne husband, haue you?

+CLAUDIO
I would scarce trust my selfe, though I had sworne
the contrarie, if Hero would be my wife.

+BENEDICKE
Ist come to this? in faith hath not the world
one man but he will weare his cap with suspition? shall
I neuer see a batcheller of three score againe? goe to yfaith,
and thou wilt needes thrust thy necke into a yoke, weare the
print of it, and sigh away sundaies: looke, don Pedro
is returned to seeke you.
SD: Enter +DON PEDRO, +JOHN the bastard.

+PEDRO
What secret hath held you here, that you
followed not to Leonatoes?

+BENEDICKE
I would your Grace would constraine mee to tell.

+PEDRO
I charge thee on thy allegeance.

+BENEDICKE
You heare, Count Claudio, I can be secret as a
dumbe man, I would haue you thinke so [but on my allegiance,
marke you this, on my allegiance] hee is in loue,
With who? now that is your Graces part: marke how short
his answere is, with Hero, Leonatoes short daughter.

+CLAUDIO
If this were so, so were it vttred.

+BENEDICKE
Like the old tale, my Lord, it is not so, nor
'twas not so: but indeede, God forbid it should be so.

+CLAUDIO
If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
should be otherwise.

+PEDRO
Amen, if you loue her, for the Ladie is verie
well worthie.

+CLAUDIO
You speake this to fetch me in, my Lord.

+PEDRO
By my troth I speake my thought.

+CLAUDIO
And in faith, my Lord, I spoke mine.

+BENEDICKE
And by my two faiths and troths, my Lord, I
speake mine.

+CLAUDIO
That I loue her, I feele.

+PEDRO
That she is worthie, I know.

+BENEDICKE
That I neither feele how shee should be loued,
nor know how shee should be worthie, is the opinion that
fire cannot melt out of me, I will die in it at the stake.

+PEDRO
Thou wast euer an obstinate heretique in the
despight of Beautie.

+CLAUDIO
And neuer could maintaine his part, but in the
force of his will.

+BENEDICKE
That a woman conceiued me, I thanke her: that
she brought mee vp, I likewise giue her most humble
thankes: but that I will haue a rechate winded in my
forehead, or hang my bugle in an inuisible baldricke, all
women shall pardon me: because I will not do them the
wrong to mistrust any, I will doe my selfe the right to trust
none: and the fine is, [for the which I may goe the finer] I
will liue a Batchellor.

+PEDRO
I shall see thee ere I die, looke pale with loue.

+BENEDICKE
With anger, with sicknesse, or with hunger, my
Lord, not with loue: proue that euer I loose more blood
with loue, then I will get againe with drinking, picke out
mine eyes with a Ballet-makers penne, and hang me vp
at the doore of a brothel-house for the signe of blinde
Cupid.

+PEDRO
Well, if euer thou doost fall from this faith,
thou wilt proue a notable argument.

+BENEDICKE
If I do, hang me in a bottle like a Cat, & shoot
at me, and he that hit's me, let him be clapt on the
shoulder, and cal'd Adam.

+PEDRO
Well, as time shall trie:
In time the sauage / Bull doth beare tne yoake.

+BENEDICKE
The sauage bull may, but if euer the sensible
Benedicke beare it, plucke off the bulles hornes, and set them
in my forehead, and let me be vildely painted, and in such
great Letters as they write, heere is good horse to hire:
let them signifie vnder my signe, here you may see
Benedicke the married man.

+CLAUDIO
If this should euer happen, thou wouldst bee
horne mad.

+PEDRO
Nay, if Cupid haue not spent all his Quiuer in
Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.

+BENEDICKE
I looke for an earthquake too then.

+PEDRO
Well, you will temporize with the houres, in
the meane time, good Signior Benedicke, repaire to Leonatoes,
commend me to him, and tell him I will not faile
him at supper, for indeede he hath made great
preparation.

+BENEDICKE
I haue almost matter enough in me for such an
Embassage, and so I commit you.

+CLAUDIO
To the tuition of God. From my house, if I had
it.

+PEDRO
The sixt of Iuly. Your louing friend,
Benedick.

+BENEDICKE
Nay mocke not, mocke not; the body of your
discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the
guardes are but slightly basted on neither, ere you flout
old ends any further, examine your conscience, and so I
leaue you.
SD: BENEDICK exits

+CLAUDIO
My Liege, your Highnesse now may doe mee good.

+PEDRO
My loue is thine to teach, teach it but how,
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learne
Any hard Lesson that may do thee good.

+CLAUDIO
Hath Leonato any sonne my Lord?

+PEDRO
No childe but Hero, she's his onely heire.
Dost thou affect her Claudio?

+CLAUDIO
O my Lord,
When you went onward on this ended action,
I look'd vpon her with a souldiers eie,
That lik'd, but had a rougher taske in hand,
Than to driue liking to the name of loue:
But now I am return'd, and that warre-thoughts
Haue left their places vacant: in their roomes,
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
All prompting mee how faire yong Hero is,
Saying I lik'd her ere I went to warres.

+PEDRO
Thou wilt be like a louer presently,
And tire the hearer with a booke of words:
If thou dost loue faire Hero, cherish it,
And I will breake with her:
wast not to this end,
That thou beganst to twist so fine a story?

+CLAUDIO
How sweetly doe you minister to loue,
That know loues griefe by his complexion!
But lest my liking might too sodaine seeme,
I would haue salu'd it with a longer treatise.

+PEDRO
What need ye bridge much broder then the flood?
The fairest graunt is the necessitie:
Looke what will serue, is fit: 'tis once, thou louest,
And I will fit thee with the remedie,
I know we shall haue reuelling to night,
I will assume thy part in some disguise,
And tell faire Hero I am Claudio,
And in her bosome Ile vnclaspe my heart,
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong incounter of my amorous tale:
Then after, to her father will I breake,
And the conclusion is, shee shall be thine,
In practise let vs put it presently.
SD: Exeunt +PEDRO, +JOHN, +CLAUDIO.

NS: Act 1, scene 2
SD: Enter +LEONATO and an old man, brother to Leonato.

+LEONATO
How now brother, where is my cosen your
son: hath he prouided this musicke?

+OLD
He is very busie about it, but brother, I can tell
you newes that you yet dreamt not of.

+LEONATO
Are they good?

+OLD
As the euents stamps them, but they haue a
good couer: they shew well outward, the Prince and
Count Claudio walking in a thick pleached alley in
my orchard, were thus ouer-heard by a man of
mine: the Prince discouered to Claudio that hee loued
my niece your daughter, and meant to acknowledge it
this night in a dance, and if hee found her accordant, hee
meant to take the present time by the top, and instantly
breake with you of it.

+LEONATO
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?

+OLD
A good sharpe fellow, I will send for him, and
question him your selfe.

+LEONATO
No, no; wee will hold it as a dreame, till it appeare
it selfe: but I will acquaint my daughter withall, that she
may be the better prepared for an answer, if peraduenture
this bee true: goe you and tell her of it:
SD: LEONATO, to cosins, says

+LEONATO
coosins, you know what you haue to doe,
O I crie you mercie friend, goe you with mee and I will
vse your skill, / good cosin haue a care this busie time.
SD: Exeunt +LEONATO and +OLD.

NS: Act 1, scene 3
SD: Enter +JOHN the Bastard, and +CONRADE his companion.

+CONRADE
What the good yeere my Lord, why are you thus
out of measure sad?

+JOHN
There is no measure in the occasion that
breeds, therefore the sadnesse is without limit.

+CONRADE
You should heare reason.

+JOHN
And when I haue heard it, what blessing bringeth
it?

+CONRADE
If not a present remedy, yet a patient
sufferance.

+JOHN
I wonder that thou [being as thou saist thou
art, borne vnder Saturne] goest about to apply a morall
medicine, to a mortifying mischiefe: I cannot hide what
I am: I must bee sad when I haue cause, and smile at no
mans iests, eat when I haue stomacke, and wait for no
mans leisure: sleepe when I am drowsie, and tend on no
mans businesse, laugh when I am merry, and claw no
man in his humor.

+CONRADE
Yea, but you must not make the ful show of this,
till you may doe it without controllment, you haue of late
stood out against your brother, and hee hath tane you
newly into his grace, where it is impossible you should
take root, but by the faire weather that you make
your selfe, it is needful that you frame the season for your
owne haruest.

+JOHN
I had rather be a canker in a hedge, then a rose
in his grace, and it better fits my bloud to be disdain'd
of all, then to fashion a carriage to rob loue from any: in
this [though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest
man] it must not be denied but I am a plaine dealing
villaine, I am trusted with a mussell, and enfranchisde with
a clog, therefore I haue decreed, not to sing in my cage:
if I had my mouth, I would bite: if I had my liberty, I
would do my liking: in the meane time, let me be that I
am, and seeke not to alter me.

+CONRADE
Can you make no vse of your discontent?

+JOHN
I will make all vse of it, for I vse it onely. Who
comes here?
SD: Enter +BORACHIO.

+JOHN
what newes Borachio?

+BORACHIO
I came yonder from a great supper, the Prince
your brother is royally entertained by Leonato, and I can
giue you intelligence of an intended marriage.

+JOHN
Will it serue for any Modell to build mischiefe
on? What is hee for a foole that betrothes himselfe to
vnquietnesse?

+BORACHIO
Mary it is your brothers right hand.

+JOHN
Who, the most exquisite Claudio?

+BORACHIO
Euen he.

+JOHN
A proper squier, and who, and who, which
way lookes he?

+BORACHIO
Mary on Hero, the daughter and Heire of
Leonato.

+JOHN
A very forward March-chicke, how came you
to this?

+BORACHIO
Being entertain'd for a perfumer, as I was
smoaking a musty roome, comes me the Prince and
Claudio, hand in hand in sad conference: I whipt
behind the Arras, and there heard it agreed vpon, that
the Prince should wooe Hero for himselfe, and hauing
obtain'd her, giue her to Count Claudio.

+JOHN
Come, come, let vs thither, this may proue
food to my displeasure, that young start-vp hath all the
glorie of my ouerthrow: if I can crosse him any way,
I blesse my selfe euery way, you are both sure, and will
assist mee?

+CONRADE
To the death my Lord.

+JOHN
Let vs to the great supper, their cheere is the
greater that I am subdued, would the Cooke were of my
minde: shall we goe proue whats to be done?

+BORACHIO
Wee'll wait vpon your Lordship.
SD: Exeunt +JOHN, +CONRADE, +BORACHIO.




NS: Act 2 Scene 1

SD: Enter +LEONATO, his brother, his wife, HERO his daughter, and BEATRICE his neece, and a kinsman.

+LEONATO
Was not Count Iohn here at supper?

+BROTHER
I saw him not.

+BEATRICE
How tartly that Gentleman lookes, I neuer can see
him, but I am heart-burn'd an howre after.

+HERO
He is of a very melancholy disposition.

+BEATRICE
Hee were an excellent man that were made iust
in the mid-way betweene him and Benedicke, the one is
too like an image and saies nothing, and the other too
like my Ladies eldest sonne, euermore tatling.

+LEONATO
Then halfe signior Benedicks tongue in Count
Iohns mouth, and halfe Count Iohns melancholy in
Signior Benedicks face.

+BEATRICE
With a good legge, and a good foot vnckle, and
money enough in his purse, such a man would winne any
woman in the world, if he could get her good will.

+LEONATO
By my troth Neece, thou wilt neuer get thee a
husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.

+BROTHER
Infaith shee's too curst.

+BEATRICE
Too curst is more then curst, I shall lessen
Gods sending that way: for it is said, God sends a curst
Cow short hornes, but to a Cow too curst he sends none.

+LEONATO
So, by being too curst, God will send you no
hornes.

+BEATRICE
Iust, if he send me no husband, for the which
blessing, I am at him vpon my knees euery morning and
euening: Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
beard on his face, I had rather lie in the woollen.

+LEONATO
You may light vpon a husband that hath no beard.

+BEATRICE
What should I doe with him? dresse him in my
apparell, and make him my waiting gentlewoman? he
that hath a beard, is more then a youth: and he that hath
no beard, is lesse then a man: and hee that is more then a
youth, is not for mee: and he that is lesse then a man, I am
not for him: therefore I will euen take sixepence in
earnest of the Berrord, and leade his Apes into hell.

+LEONATO
Well then, goe you into hell.

+BEATRICE
No, but to the gate, and there will the Deuill
meete mee like an old Cuckold with hornes on his head,
and say, get you to heauen Beatrice, get you to heauen,
heere's no place for you maids, so deliuer I vp my Apes,
and away to S. Peter: for the heauens, hee shewes mee
where the Batchellers sit, and there liue wee as merry as
the day is long.

+BROTHER
Well neece, I trust you will be rul'd
by your father.

+BEATRICE
Yes faith, it is my cosens dutie to make
curtsie, and say, as it please you: but yet for all
that cosin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make
an other cursie, and say, father, as it please me.

+LEONATO
Well neece, I hope to see you one day fitted with
a husband.

+BEATRICE
Not till God make men of some other mettall
then earth, would it not grieue a woman to be
ouermastred with a peece of valiant dust? to make
account of her life to a clod of waiward marle? no
vnckle, ile none: Adams sonnes are my brethren, and
truly I hold it a sinne to match in my kinred.

+LEONATO
Daughter, remember what I told you, if the
Prince doe solicit you in that kinde, you know your
answere.

+BEATRICE
The fault will be in the musicke cosin, if you
be not woed in good time: if the Prince bee too important,
tell him there is measure in euery thing, & so dance
out the answere, for heare me Hero, wooing, wedding,
& repenting, is as a Scotch ijgge, a measure, and a
cinque-pace: the first suite is hot and hasty like a Scotch
ijgge [and full as fantasticall] the wedding manerly modest,
[as a measure] full of state & aunchentry, and
then comes repentance, and with his bad legs falls into
the cinque-pace faster and faster, till he sinkes into his
graue.

+LEONATO
Cosin you apprehend passing shrewdly.

+BEATRICE
I haue a good eye vnckle, I can see a Church
by daylight.

+LEONATO
The reuellers are entring brother, make good
roome.

SD: Enter +PRINCE, +PEDRO, +CLAUDIO, and +BENEDICK, and +BALTHASAR, or dumbe +IOHN, Maskers with a drum.

+PEDRO
Lady, will you walke about with your friend?

+HERO
So you walke softly, and looke sweetly, and say
nothing, I am yours for the walke, and especially when
I walke away.

+PEDRO
With me in your company.

+HERO
I may say so when I please.

+PEDRO
And when please you to say so?

+HERO
When I like your fauour, for God defend the Lute
should be like the case.

+PEDRO
My visor is Philemons roofe, within the house is Loue.

+HERO
Why then your visor should be thatcht.

+PEDRO
Speake low if you speake
Loue.

+BENEDICK
Well, I would you did like me.

+MAR
So would not I for your owne sake, for I haue
manie ill qualities.

+BENEDICK
Which is one?

+MAR
I say my prayers alowd.

+BENEDICK
I loue you the better, the hearers may cry
Amen.

+MAR
God match me with a good dauncer.

+BALTHASAR
Amen.

+MAR
And God keepe him out of my sight when the
daunce is done: answer Clarke.

+BALTHASAR
No more words, the Clarke is answered.

+URSULA
I know you well enough, you are Signior Anthonio.

+ANTH
At a word, I am not.

+URSULA
I know you by the wagling of your head.

+ANTH
To tell you true, I counterfet him.

+URSU
You could neuer doe him so ill well, vnlesse you
were the very man: here's his dry hand vp & down,
you are he, you are he.

+ANTH
At a word I am not.

+URSULA
Come, come, doe you thinke I doe not know you by
your excellent wit? can vertue hide it selfe? goe to, mumme,
you are he, graces will appeare, and there's an end.

+BEATRICE
Will you not tell me who told you so?

+BENEDICK
No, you shall pardon me.

+BEATRICE
Nor will you not tell me who you are?

+BENEDICK
Not now.

+BEATRICE
That I was disdainfull, and that I had my good
wit out of the hundred merry tales: well, this was
Signior Benedicke that said so.

+BENEDICK
What's he?

+BEATRICE
I am sure you know him well enough.

+BENEDICK
Not I, beleeue me.

+BEATRICE
Did he neuer make you laugh?

+BENEDICK
I pray you what is he?

+BEATRICE
Why he is the Princes ieaster, a very dull foole,
onely his gift is, in deuising impossible slanders, none but
Libertines delight in him, and the commendation is not
in his witte, but in his villanie, for hee both pleaseth men
and angers them, and then they laugh at him, and beat
him: I am sure he is in the Fleet, I would he had boorded
me.

+BENEDICK
When I know the Gentleman, Ile tell him what
you say.

+BEATRICE
Do, do, hee'l but breake a comparison or two
on me, which peraduenture [not markt, or not laugh'd
at] strikes him into melancholly, and then there's a
Partridge wing saued, for the foole will eate no supper
that night.

+PEDRO
We must follow the Leaders.

+BENEDICK
In euery good thing.

+BEATRICE
Nay, if they leade to any ill, I will leaue them at
the next turning.
SD: BEATRICE, +BENEDICK, +URSULA, +ANTH, +BALTHASAR, +MAR, +HERO, +LEONATO, +CLAUDIO, +PEDRO, +PRINCE exits.

SD: Musicke for the dance.

+IOHN
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath
withdrawne her father to breake with him about it: the
Ladies follow her, and but one visor remaines.

+BORACHIO
And that is Claudio, I know him by his
bearing.

+IOHN
Are not you signior Benedicke?

+CLAUDIO
You know me well, I am hee.

+IOHN
Signior, you are verie neere my Brother in his
loue, he is enamor'd on Hero, I pray you disswade
him from her, she is no equall for his birth: you may
do the part of an honest man in it.

+CLAUDIO
How know you he loues her?

+IOHN
I heard him sweare his affection,

+BORACHIO
So did I too, and he swore he would marrie her
to night.

+IOHN
Come, let vs to the banquet.
SD: +IOHN, +BORACHIO exits.
SD: manet +CLAUDIO

+CLAUDIO
Thus answere I in name of Benedicke,
But heare these ill newes with the eares of Claudio:
'Tis certaine so, the Prince woes for himselfe:
Friendship is constant in all other things,
Saue in the Office and affaires of loue:
Therefore all hearts in loue vse their owne tongues.
Let euerie eye negotiate for it selfe,
And trust no Agent: for beautie is a witch,
Against whose charmes, faith melteth into blood:
This is an accident of hourely proofe,
Which I mistrusted not. Farewell therefore Hero.

SD: Enter +BENEDICK.

+BENEDICK
Count Claudio.

+CLAUDIO
Yea, the same.

+BENEDICK
Come, will you go with me?

+CLAUDIO
Whither?

+BENEDICK
Euen to the next Willow, about your own businesse,
Count. What fashion will you weare the Garland
off? About your necke, like an Vsurers chaine? Or vnder
your arme, like a Lieutenants scarfe? You must weare it
one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero.

+CLAUDIO
I wish him ioy of her.

+BENEDICK
Why that's spoken like an honest Drouier, so
they sel Bullockes: but did you thinke the Prince wold
haue serued you thus?

+CLAUDIO
I pray you leaue me.

+BENEDICK
Ho now you strike like the blindman, 'twas
the boy that stole your meate, and you'l beat the post.

+CLAUDIO
If it will not be, Ile leaue you.
SD: +CLAUDIO exits.

+BENEDICK
Alas poore hurt fowle, now will he creepe into
sedges: But that my Ladie Beatrice should know me,
& not know me: the Princes foole! Hah? It may be I
goe vnder that title, because I am merrie: yea but so I am
apt to do my selfe wrong: I am not so reputed, it is the
base [though bitter] disposition of Beatrice, that putt's the
world into her person, and so giues me out: well, Ile be
reuenged as I may.

SD: Enter the +PRINCE.

+PEDRO
Now Signior, where's the Count, did you
see him?

+BENEDICK
Troth my Lord, I haue played the part of Lady
Fame, I found him heere as melancholy as a Lodge in a
Warren, I told him, and I thinke, told him true, that
your grace had got the will of this young Lady, and
I offered him my company to a willow tree, either to
make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to binde him
a rod, as being worthy to be whipt.

+PEDRO
To be whipt, what's his fault?

+BENEDICK
The flat transgression of a Schoole-boy, who
being ouer-ioyed with finding a birds nest, shewes it his
companion, and he steales it.

+PEDRO
Wilt thou make a trust, a transgression? the
transgression is in the stealer.

+BENEDICK
Yet it had not beene amisse the rod had beene
made, and the garland too, for the garland he might
haue worne himselfe, and the rod hee might haue bestowed
on you, who [as I take it] haue stolne his birds nest.

+PEDRO
I will but teach them to sing, and restore them
to the owner.

+BENEDICK
If their singing answer your saying, by my
faith you say honestly.

+PEDRO
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrell to you, the
Gentleman that daunst with her, told her shee is much
wrong'd by you.

+BENEDICK
O she misusde me past the indurance of a
block: an oake but with one greene leafe on it, would haue
answered her: my very visor began to assume life, and
scold with her: shee told mee, not thinking I had beene
my selfe, that I was the Princes Iester, and that I was duller
then a great thaw, hudling iest vpon iest, with such
impossible conueiance vpon me, that I stood like a man
at a marke, with a whole army shooting at me: shee
speakes poynyards, and euery word stabbes: if her breath
were as terrible as terminations, there were no liuing
neere her, she would infect to the north starre: I would not
marry her, though she were indowed with all that
Adam had left him before he transgrest, she would
haue made Hercules haue turnd spit, yea, and haue cleft
his club to make the fire too: come, talke not of her, you
shall finde her the infernall Ate in good apparell. I would to
God some scholler would coniure her, for certainely while
she is heere, a man may liue as quiet in hell, as in a sanctuary,
and people sinne vpon purpose, because they would
goe thither, so indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation
followes her.

SD: Enter +CLAUDIO and +BEATRICE, +LEONATO, +HERO.

+PEDRO
Looke heere she comes.

+BENEDICK
Will your Grace command mee any seruice to
the worlds end? I will goe on the slightest arrand now
to the Antypodes that you can deuise to send me on: I
will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the furthest inch
of Asia: bring you the length of Prester Iohns foot: fetch
you a hayre off the great Chams beard: doe you any
embassage to the Pigmies, rather then hould three words
conference, with this Harpy: you haue no employment
for me?

+PEDRO
None, but to desire your good company.

+BENEDICK
O God sir, heeres a dish I loue not, I cannot
indure this Lady tongue.
SD: +BENEDICK exits.

+PEDRO
Come Lady, come, you haue lost the heart of
Signior Benedicke.

+BEATRICE
Indeed my Lord, hee lent it me a while, and I
gaue him vse for it, a double heart for a single one,
marry once before he wonne it of mee, with false dice,
therefore your Grace may well say I haue lost it.

+PEDRO
You haue put him downe Lady, you haue put
him downe.

+BEATRICE
So I would not he should do me, my Lord, lest
I should prooue the mother of fooles: I haue brought
Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seeke.

+PEDRO
Why how now Count, wherfore are you
sad?

+CLAUDIO
Not sad my Lord.

+PEDRO
How then? sicke?

+CLAUDIO
Neither, my Lord.

+BEATRICE
The Count is neither sad, nor sicke, nor merry,
nor well: but ciuill Count, ciuill as an Orange, and something
of a iealous complexion.

+PEDRO
Ifaith Lady, I thinke your blazon to be true,
though Ile be sworne, if hee be so, his conceit is false:
heere Claudio, I haue wooed in thy name, and faire
Hero is won, I haue broke with her father, and his good
will obtained, name the day of marriage, and God giue
thee ioy.

+LEONATO
Count, take of me my daughter, and with her
my fortunes: his grace hath made the match, & all
grace say, Amen to it.

+BEATRICE
Speake Count, tis your Qu.

+CLAUDIO
Silence is the perfectest Herault of ioy, I were
but little happy if I could say, how much? Lady, as you
are mine, I am yours, I giue away my selfe for you, and
doat vpon the exchange.

+BEATRICE
Speake cosin, or [if you cannot] stop his mouth
with a kisse, and let not him speake neither.

+PEDRO
In faith Lady you haue a merry heart.

+BEATRICE
Yea my Lord I thanke it, poore foole it keepes on
the windy side of Care, my coosin tells him in his eare
that he is in my heart.

+CLAUDIO
And so she doth coosin.

+BEATRICE
Good Lord for alliance: thus goes euery one
to the world but I, and I am sun-burn'd, I may sit in a
corner and cry, heigh ho for a husband.

+PEDRO
Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.

+BEATRICE
I would rather haue one of your fathers getting:
hath your Grace ne're a brother like you? your
father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by
them.

+PRINCE
Will you haue me? Lady.

+BEATRICE
No, my Lord, vnlesse I might haue another for
working-daies, your Grace is too costly to weare euerie
day: but I beseech your Grace pardon mee, I was borne
to speake all mirth, and no matter.

+PRINCE
Your silence most offends me, and to be
merry, best becomes you, for out of question, you were
born in a merry howre.

+BEATRICE
No sure my Lord, my Mother cried, but then
there was a starre daunst, and vnder that was I borne:
cosins God giue you ioy.

+LEONATO
Neece, will you looke to those rhings I told you
of?

+BEATRICE
I cry you mercy Vncle, by
your Graces pardon.
SD: BEATRICE exits.

+PRINCE
By my troth a pleasant spirited Lady.

+LEONATO
There's little of the melancholy element in her
my Lord, she is neuer sad, but when she sleepes, and not
euer sad then: for I haue heard my daughter say, she hath
often dreamt of vnhappinesse, and wakt her selfe with
laughing.

+PEDRO
Shee cannot indure to heare tell of a husband.

+LEONATO
O, by no meanes, she mocks all her wooers out
of suite.

+PRINCE
She were an excellent wife for Benedick.

+LEONATO
O Lord, my Lord, if they were but a weeke
married, they would talke themselues madde.

+PRINCE
Counte Claudio, when meane you to goe to
Church?

+CLAUDIO
To morrow my Lord, Time goes on crutches,
till Loue haue all his rites.

+LEONATO
Not till monday, my deare sonne, which is hence
a iust seuen night, and a time too briefe too, to haue all
things answer minde.

+PRINCE
Come, you shake the head at so long a
breathing, but I warrant thee Claudio, the time shall
not goe dully by vs, I will in the interim, vndertake one
of Hercules labors, which is, to bring Signior Benedicke
and the Lady Beatrice into a mountaine of affection,
th'one with th'other, I would faine haue it a match, and
I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but
minister such assistance as I shall giue you direction.

+LEONATO
My Lord, I am for you, though it cost mee ten
nights watchings.

+CLAUDIO
And I my Lord.

+PRINCE
And you to gentle Hero?

+HERO
I will doe any modest office, my Lord, to helpe my
cosin to a good husband.

+PRINCE
And Benedick is not the vnhopefullest husband
that I know: thus farre can I praise him, hee is of a
noble straine, of approued valour, and confirm'd honesty,
I will teach you how to humour your cosin, that shee
shall fall in loue with Benedicke, and I, with your two
helpes, will so practise on Benedicke, that in despight of
his quicke wit, and his queasie stomacke, hee shall fall in
loue with Beatrice: if wee can doe this, Cupid is no
longer an Archer, his glory shall be ours, for wee are the
onely loue-gods, goe in with me, and I will tell you my
drift.

NS: Act 2, scene 2
Enter +IOHN and +BORACHIO.

+IOHN
It is so, the Count Claudio shal marry the
daughter of Leonato.

+BORACHIO
Yea my Lord, but I can crosse it.

+IOHN
Any barre, any crosse, any impediment, will be
medicinable to me, I am sicke in displeasure to him,
and whatsoeuer comes athwart his affection, ranges
euenly with mine, how canst thou crosse this marriage?

+BORACHIO
Not honestly my Lord, but so couertly, that
no dishonesty shall appeare in me.

+IOHN
Shew me breefely how.

+BORACHIO
I thinke I told your Lordship a yeere since, how
much I am in the fauour of Margaret, the
waiting gentle-woman to Hero.

+IOHN
I remember.

+BORACHIO
I can at any vnseasonable instant of the night,
appoint her to look out at her Ladies chamber window.

+IOHN
What life is in that, to be the death of this
marriage?

+BORACHIO
The poyson of that lies in you to temper, goe
you to the Prince your brother, spare not to tell him,
that hee hath wronged his Honor in marrying the renowned
Claudio, whose estimation do you mightily
hold vp, to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.

+IOHN
What proofe shall I make of that?

+BORACHIO
Proofe enough, to misuse the Prince, to vexe
Claudio, to vndoe Hero, and kill Leonato, looke you for
any other issue?

+IOHN
Onely to despight them, I will endeauour
any thing.

+BORACHIO
Goe then, finde me a meete howre, to draw on
Pedro and the Count Claudio alone, tell them that
you know that Hero loues me, intend a kinde of zeale both
to the Prince and Claudio [as in a loue of your brothers
honor who hath made this match] and his friends
reputation, who is thus like to be cosen'd with the semblance
of a maid, that you haue discouer'd thus: they
will scarcely beleeue this without triall: offer them
instances which shall beare no lesse likelihood, than to
see mee at her chamber window, heare me call Margaret,
Hero; heare Margaret terme me Claudio, and bring them
to see this the very night before the intended wedding,
for in the meane time, I will so fashion the matter, that
Hero shall be absent, and there shall appeare such seeming
truths of Heroes disloyaltie, that iealousie shall be cal'd
assurance, and all the preparation ouerthrowne.

+IOHN
Grow this to what aduerse issue it can, I will
put it in practise: be cunning in the working this, and
thy fee is a thousand ducates.

+BORACHIO
Be thou constant in the accusation, and my
cunning shall not shame me.

+IOHN
I will presentlie goe learne their day of marriage.

NS: Act 2 Scene 3
SD: Enter +BENEDICKE alone.
+BENEDICK
Boy.
Boy.
Signior.
+BENEDICK
In my chamber window lies a booke, bring it
hither to me in the orchard.
Boy.
I am heere already sir.
+BENEDICK
I know that, but I would haue thee hence, and
heere againe.
I doe much wonder, that one man seeing how much
another man is a foole, when he dedicates his behauiours
to loue, will after hee hath laught at such shallow
follies in others, become the argument of his owne
scorne, by falling in loue, & such a man is Claudio, I
haue known when there was no musicke with him but the
drum and the fife, and now had hee rather heare the taber
and the pipe: I haue knowne when he would haue walkt
ten mile afoot, to see a good armor, and now will he lie
ten nights awake caruing the fashion of a new dublet:
he was wont to speake plaine, & to the purpose [like an
honest man & a souldier] and now is he turn'd orthography,
his words are a very fantasticall banquet, iust so
many strange dishes: may I be so conuerted, & see with
these eyes? I cannot tell, I thinke not: I will not bee
sworne, but loue may transforme me to an oyster, but Ile
take my oath on it, till he haue made an oyster of me, he
shall neuer make me such a foole: one woman is faire, yet
I am well: another is wise, yet I am well: another vertuous,
yet I am well: but till all graces be in one woman,
one woman shall not come in my grace: rich shee shall
be, that's certaine: wise, or Ile none: vertuous, or Ile
neuer cheapen her: faire, or Ile neuer looke on her: milde,
or come not neere me: Noble, or not for an Angell: of
good discourse: an excellent Musitian, and her haire shal
be of what colour it please God, hah! the PRINCE and
Monsieur Loue, I will hide me in the Arbor.
SD: Enter +PRINCE, +LEONATO, +CLAUDIO, and +JACKE WILSON.
+PRINCE
Come, shall we heare this musicke?
+CLAUDIO
Yea my good Lord: how still the euening is,
As husht on purpose to grace harmonie.
+PRINCE
See you where Benedicke hath hid himselfe?
+CLAUDIO
O very well my Lord: the musicke ended,
Wee'll fit the kid-foxe with a penny worth.
+PRINCE
Come +BALTHASAR, wee'll heare that song again.
+BALTHASAR
O good my Lord, taxe not so bad a voyce,
To slander musicke any more then once.
+PRINCE
It is the witnesse still of excellency, / To slander Musicke any more then once. / +PRINCE. It is the witnesse still of excellencie,
To put a strange face on his owne perfection,
I pray thee sing, and let me woe no more.
+BALTHASAR
Because you talke of wooing, I will sing,
Since many a wooer doth commence his suit,
To her he thinkes not worthy, yet he wooes,
Yet will he sweare he loues.
+PRINCE
Nay pray thee come,
Or if thou wilt hold longer argument,
Doe it in notes.
+BALTHASAR
Note this before my notes,
Theres not a note of mine that's worth the noting.
+PRINCE
Why these are very crotchets that he speaks,
Note notes forsooth, and nothing.
+BENEDICK
Now diuine aire, now is his soule rauisht, is
it not strange that sheepes guts should hale soules out of
mens bodies? well, a horne for my money when all's
done.
SD: The Song.
Sigh no more Ladies, sigh no more,
Men were deceiuers euer,
One foote in Sea, and one on shore,
To one thing constant neuer,
Then sigh not so, but let them goe,
And be you blithe and bonnie,
Conuerting all your sounds of woe,
Into hey nony nony.
Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
Of dumps so dull and heauy,
The fraud of men were euer so,
Since summer first was leauy,
Then sigh not so, &c.
+PRINCE
By my troth a good song.
+BALTHASAR
And an ill singer, my Lord.
+PRINCE
Ha, no, no faith, thou singst well enough
for a shift.
+BENEDICK
And he had been a dog that should haue
howld thus, they would haue hang'd him, and I pray
God his bad voyce bode no mischiefe, I had as liefe haue
heard the night-rauen, come what plague could haue
come after it.
+PRINCE
Yea marry, dost thou heare +BALTHASAR? I
pray thee get vs some excellent musick: for to morrow
night we would haue it at the Lady Heroes
chamber window.
+BALTHASAR
The best I can, my Lord.
+PRINCE
Do so, farewell.
SD: +Balthasar exits.
+PRINCE
Come hither +LEONATO, what was it you told me of to day,
that your Niece +BEATRICE was in loue with signior
Benedicke?
+CLAUDIO
O I, stalke on, stalke on/span>, the foule sits. I
did neuer thinke that Lady would haue loued any man.
+LEONATO
No, nor I neither, but most wonderful, that
she should so dote on Signior Benedicke, whom shee hath
in all outward behauiours seemed euer to abhorre.
+BENEDICK
Is't possible? sits the winde in that
corner?
+LEONATO
By my troth my Lord, I cannot tell what to
thinke of it, but that she loues him with an inraged affection,
it is past the infinite of thought.
+PRINCE
May be she doth but counterfeit.
+CLAUDIO
Faith like enough.
+LEONATO
O God! counterfeit? there was neuer counterfeit
of passion, came so neere the life of passion as she
discouers it.
+PRINCE
Why what effects of passion shewes she?
+CLAUDIO
Baite the hooke well,
this fish will bite.
+LEONATO
What effects my Lord? shee will sit you, you
heard my daughter tell you how.
+CLAUDIO
She did indeed.
+PRINCE
How, how I pray you? you amaze me, I
would haue thought her spirit had beene inuincible
against all assaults of affection.
+LEONATO
I would haue sworne it had, my Lord, especially
against Benedicke.
+BENEDICK
I should thinke this a gull, but that the
white-bearded fellow speakes it: knauery cannot sure
hide himselfe in such reuerence.
+CLAUDIO
He hath tane th'
infection, hold it vp.
+PRINCE
Hath shee made her affection known to
Benedicke?
+LEONATO
No, and sweares she neuer will, that's her
torment.
+CLAUDIO
'Tis true indeed, so your daughter saies: shall
I, saies she, that haue so oft encountred him with
scorne, write to him that I loue him?
+LEONATO
This saies shee now when shee is beginning to
write to him, for shee'll be vp twenty times a night, and
there will she sit in her smocke, till she haue writ a sheet
of paper: my daughter tells vs all.
+CLAUDIO
Now you talke of a sheet of paper, I remember
a pretty iest your daughter told vs of.
+LEONATO
O when she had writ it, & was reading it
ouer, she found Benedicke and Beatrice betweene the
sheete.
+CLAUDIO
That.
+LEONATO
O she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence,
raild at her self, that she should be so immodest
to write, to one that shee knew would flout her:
I measure him, saies she, by my owne spirit, for I
should flout him if hee writ to mee, yea though I loue
him, I should.
+CLAUDIO
Then downe vpon her knees she falls, weepes,
sobs, beates her heart, teares her hayre, praies, curses, O
sweet Benedicke, God giue me patience.
+LEONATO
She doth indeed, my daughter saies so, and the
extasie hath so much ouerborne her, that my daughter
is somtime afeard she will doe a desperate out-rage to
her selfe, it is very true.
+PRINCE
It were good that Benedicke knew of it by
some other, if she will not discouer it.
+CLAUDIO
To what end? he would but make a sport of it,
and torment the poore Lady worse.
+PRINCE
And he should, it were an almes to hang him,
shee's an excellent sweet Lady, and [out of all suspition,]
she is vertuous.
CLAUDIO
And she is exceeding wise.
+PRINCE
In euery thing, but in louing Benedicke.
+LEONATO
O my Lord, wisedome and bloud combating in so
tender a body, we haue ten proofes to one, that bloud
hath the victory, I am sorry for her, as I haue iust cause,
being her Vncle, and her Guardian.
+PRINCE
I would shee had bestowed this dotage on mee,
I would haue daft all other respects, and made her halfe
my selfe: I pray you tell Benedicke of it, and heare what
he will say.
+LEONATO
Were it good thinke you?
+CLAUDIO
Hero thinkes surely she wil die, for she saies she
will die, if hee loue her not, and shee will die ere shee make
her loue knowne, and she will die if hee wooe her, rather
than shee will bate one breath of her accustomed
crossenesse.
+PRINCE
She doth well, if she should make tender of
her loue, 'tis very possible hee'l scorne it, for the man
[as you know all] hath a contemptible spirit.
+CLAUDIO
He is a very proper man.
+PRINCE
He hath indeed a good outward happines.
+CLAUDIO
'Fore God, and in my minde very wise.
+PRINCE
He doth indeed shew some sparkes that are
like wit.
+LEONATO
And I take him to be valiant.
+PRINCE
As Hector, I assure you, and in the managing
of quarrels you may see hee is wise, for either hee
auoydes them with great discretion, or vndertakes them
with a Christian-like feare.
+LEONATO
If hee doe feare God, a must necessarilie keepe
peace, if hee breake the peace, hee ought to enter into a
quarrell with feare and trembling.
+PRINCE
And so will he doe, for the man doth fear God,
howsoeuer it seemes not in him, by some large ieasts hee
will make: well, I am sorry for your niece, shall we goe
see Benedicke, and tell him of her loue.
+CLAUDIO
Neuer tell him, my Lord, let her weare it out with
good counsell.
+LEONATO
Nay that's impossible, she may weare her heart
out first.
+PRINCE
Well, we will heare further of it by your
daughter, let it coole the while, I loue Benedicke well, and
I could wish he would modestly examine himselfe, to see
how much he is vnworthy to haue so good a Lady.
+LEONATO
My Lord, will you walke? dinner is ready.
+CLAUDIO
If he do not doat on her vpon this, I wil
neuer trust my expectation.
+PRINCE
Let there be the same Net spread
for her, and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman
carry: the sport will be, when they hold one
an opinion of anothers dotage, and no such matter,
that's the Scene that I would see, which will be meerely a
dumbe shew: let vs send her to call him into dinner.
SD: Exuent +PRINCE, +CLAUDIO, +BENEDICK, +LEONATO.
+BENEDICK
This can be no tricke, the
conference was sadly borne, they haue the truth of this
from Hero, they seeme to pittie the Lady: it seemes her
affections haue the full bent: loue me? why it must
be requited: I heare how I am censur'd, they say I will
beare my selfe proudly, if I perceiue the loue come from
her: they say too, that she will rather die than giue any
signe of affection: I did neuer thinke to marry, I must not
seeme proud, happy are they that heare their detractions,
and can put them to mending: they say the Lady is faire,
'tis a truth, I can beare them witnesse: and vertuous, tis so,
I cannot reprooue it, and wise, but for louing me, by my
troth it is no addition to her witte, nor no great argument
of her folly; for I wil be horribly in loue with her, I may
chance haue some odde quirkes and remnants of witte broken
on mee, because I haue rail'd so long against marriage:
but doth not the appetite alter? a man loues the meat in
his youth, that he cannot indure in his age. Shall quips
and sentences, and these paper bullets of the braine awe a
man from the careere of his humour? No, the world must
be peopled. When I said I would die a batcheler, I did
not think I should liue till I were maried, here comes
+BEATRICE: by this day, shee's a faire Lady, I doe spie some
markes of loue in her.
SD: Enter +BEATRICE.
+BEATRICE
Against my wil I am sent to bid you come in to
dinner.
+BENEDICK
Faire +BEATRICE, I thanke you for your paines.
+BEATRICE
I tooke no more paines for those thankes, then
you take paines to thanke me, if it had been painefull, I
would not haue come.
+BENEDICK
You take pleasure then in the message.
+BEATRICE
Yea iust so much as you may take vpon a
kniues point, and choake a daw withall: you haue no
stomacke signior, fare you well.
SD: +Beatrice exits.
+BENEDICK
Ha, against my will I am sent to bid you
come into dinner: there's a double meaning in that: I
tooke no more paines for those thankes then you tooke paines
to thanke me, that's as much as to say, any paines that
I take for you is as easie as thankes: if I do not take pitty of
her I am a villaine, if I doe not loue her I am a Iew, I will
goe get her picture.
SD: +Benedick exits.
NS: Act 3 Scene 1
SD: Enter +HERO and two Gentlemen, +MARGARET, and +URSULA.
+HERO
Good +MARGARET runne thee to the parlour,
There shalt thou finde my Cosin +BEATRICE,
Proposing with the Prince and Claudio,
Whisper her eare, and tell her I and +URSULA,
Walke in the Orchard, and our whole discourse
Is all of her, say that thou ouer-heardst vs,
And bid her steale into the pleached bower,
Where hony-suckles ripened by the sunne,
Forbid the sunne to enter: like fauourites,
Made proud by Princes, that aduance their pride,
Against that power that bred it, there will she hide her,
To listen our purpose, this is thy office,
Beare thee well in it, and leaue vs alone.
+MARGARET
Ile make her come I warrant you presently.
+HERO
Now +URSULA, when +BEATRICE doth come,
As we do trace this alley vp and downe,
Our talke must onely be of Benedicke,
When I doe name him, let it be thy part,
To praise him more then euer man did merit,
My talke to thee must be how Benedicke
Is sicke in loue with +BEATRICE: of this matter,
Is little Cupids crafty arrow made,
That onely wounds by heare-say: now begin,
SD: Enter BEATRICE.
SD: For looke where +BEATRICE like a Lapwing runs
Close by the ground, to heare our conference.
+URSULA
The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
Cut with her golden ores the siluer streame,
And greedily deuoure the treacherous baite:
So angle we for +BEATRICE, who euen now,
Is couched in the wood-bine couerture,
Feare you not my part of the Dialogue.
+HERO
Then go we neare her that her eare loose nothing,
Of the false sweete baite that we lay for it:
No truely +URSULA, she is too disdainfull,
I know her spirits are as coy and wilde,
As Haggerds of the rocke.
URSULA
But are you sure,
That Benedicke loues +BEATRICE so intirely?
+HERO
So saies the Prince, and my new trothed Lord.
+URSULA
And did they bid you tell her of it, Madam?
+HERO
They did intreate me to acquaint her of it,
But I perswaded them, if they lou'd Benedicke,
To wish him wrastle with affection,
And neuer to let +BEATRICE know of it.
URSULA
Why did you so, doth not the Gentleman
Deserue as full as fortunate a bed,
As euer +BEATRICE shall couch vpon?
+HERO
O God of loue! I know he doth deserue,
As much as may be yeelded to a man:
But Nature neuer fram'd a womans heart,
Of prowder stuffe then that of +BEATRICE:
Disdaine and Scorne ride sparkling in her eyes,
Mis-prizing what they looke on, and her wit
Values it selfe so highly, that to her
All matter else seemes weake: she cannot loue,
Nor take no shape nor proiect of affection,
Shee is so selfe indeared.
URSULA
Sure I thinke so,
And therefore certainely it were not good
She knew his loue, lest she make sport at it.
+HERO
Why you speake truth, I neuer yet saw man,
How wise, how noble, yong, how rarely featur'd.
But she would spell him backward: if faire fac'd,
She would sweare the gentleman should be her sister:
If blacke, why Nature drawing of an anticke,
Made a foule blot: if tall, a launce ill headed:
If low, an agot very vildlie cut:
If speaking, why a vane blowne with all windes:
If silent, why a blocke moued with none.
So turnes she euery man the wrong side out,
And neuer giues to Truth and Vertue, that
Which simplenesse and merit purchaseth.
Ursu.
Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
+HERO
No, not to be so odde, and from all fashions,
As +BEATRICE is, cannot be commendable,
But who dare tell her so? if I should speake,
She would mocke me into ayre, O she would laugh me
Out of my selfe, presse me to death with wit,
Therefore let Benedicke like couered fire,
Consume away in sighes, waste inwardly:
It were a better death, to die with mockes,
Which is as bad as die with tickling.
Vrsu.
Yet tell her of it, heare what shee will say.
+HERO
No, rather I will goe to Benedicke,
And counsaile him to fight against his passion,
And truly Ile deuise some honest slanders,
To staine my cosin with, one doth not know,
How much an ill word may impoison liking.
Vrsu.
O doe not doe your cosin such a wrong,
She cannot be so much without true iudgement,
Hauing so swift and excellent a wit
As she is prisde to haue, as to refuse
So rare a Gentleman as signior Benedicke.
+HERO
He is the onely man of Italy,
Alwaies excepted, my deare Claudio.
Vrsu.
I pray you be not angry with me, Madame,
Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedicke,
For shape, for bearing argument and valour,
Goes formost in report through Italy.
+HERO
Indeed he hath an excellent good name.
Vrsu.
His excellence did earne it ere he had it:
When are you married Madame?
+HERO
Why euerie day to morrow, come goe in,
Ile shew thee some attires, and haue thy counsell,
Which is the best to furnish me to morrow.
Vrsu.
Shee's tane I warrant you, / We haue caught her Madame?
+HERO
If it proue so, then louing goes by haps,
Some Cupid kills with arrowes, some with traps.
SD: +Hero exits.
+BEATRICE
What fire is in mine eares? can this be true?
Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorne so much?
Contempt, farewell, and maiden pride, adew,
No glory liues behinde the backe of such.
And Benedicke, loue on, I will requite thee,
Taming my wilde heart to thy louing hand:
If thou dost loue, my kindenesse shall incite thee
To binde our loues vp in a holy band.
For others say thou dost deserue, and I
Beleeue it better then reportingly.
SD: +Beatrice exits.
NS: Act 3 Scene 2
SD: Enter +PRINCE, +CLAUDIO, +BENEDICK, and +LEONATO.
+PRINCE
I doe but stay till your marriage be consummate,
and then go I toward Arragon.
+CLAUDIO
Ile bring you thither my Lord, if you'l vouchsafe
me.
+PRINCE
Nay, that would be as great a soyle in the new
glosse of your marriage, as to shew a childe his new coat
and forbid him to weare it, I will onely bee bold with Benedicke
for his companie, for from the crowne of his head,
to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth, he hath twice or
thrice cut Cupids bow-string, and the little hang-man
dare not shoot at him, he hath a heart as sound as a
bell, and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart
thinkes, his tongue speakes.
+BENEDICK
Gallants, I am not as I haue bin.
+LEONATO
So say I, methinkes you are sadder.
+CLAUDIO
I hope he be in loue.
+PRINCE
Hang him truant, there's no true drop of
bloud in him to be truly toucht with loue, if he be sad,
he wants money.
+BENEDICK
I haue the tooth-ach.
+PRINCE
Draw it.
+BENEDICK
Hang it.
+CLAUDIO
You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
+PRINCE
What? sigh for the tooth-ach.
+LEONATO
Where is but a humour or a worme.
+BENEDICK
Well, euery one cannot master a griefe, but hee that
has it.
+CLAUDIO
Yet say I, he is in loue.
+PRINCE
There is no appearance of fancie in him, vnlesse
it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises, as to
bee a Dutchman to day, a Frenchman to morrow:
vnlesse hee haue a fancy to this
foolery, as it appeares hee hath, hee is no foole for fancy, as
you would haue it to appeare he is.
+CLAUDIO
If he be not in loue vvith some woman, there is
no beleeuing old signes, a brushes his hat a mornings,
What should that bode?
+PRINCE
Hath any man seene him at the Barbers?
+CLAUDIO
No, but the Barbers man hath beene seen with
him, and the olde ornament of his cheeke hath alreadie
stuft tennis balls.
+LEONATO
Indeed he lookes yonger than hee did, by the
losse of a beard.
+PRINCE
Nay a rubs himselfe with Ciuit, can you smell
him out by that?
+CLAUDIO
That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in
loue.
+PRINCE
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
+CLAUDIO
And when was he wont to wash his face?
+PRINCE
Yea, or to paint himselfe? for the which I heare
what they say of him.
+CLAUDIO
Nay, but his iesting spirit, which is now crept
into a lute-string, and now gouern'd by stops.
+PRINCE
Indeed that tels a heauy tale for him: conclude,
he is in loue.
+CLAUDIO
Nay, but I know who loues him.
PRINCE
That would I know too, I warrant one that
knowes him not.
+CLAUDIO
Yes, and his ill conditions, and in despight of all,
dies for him.
+PRINCE
Shee shall be buried with her face vpwards.
+BENEDICK
Yet is this no charme for the tooth-ake, old
signior, walke aside with mee, I haue studied eight or nine
wise words to speake to you, which these hobby-horses
must not heare.
+PRINCE
For my life to breake with him about +BEATRICE.
+CLAUDIO
'Tis euen so, Hero and +MARGARET haue by this
played their parts with +BEATRICE, and then the two Beares
will not bite one another when they meete.
SD: Enter +JOHN the Bastard.
BAST
My Lord and brother, God saue you.
+PRINCE
Good den brother.
BAST
If your leisure seru'd, I would speake with you.
+PRINCE
In priuate?
BAST
If it please you, yet Count Claudio may heare,
for what I would speake of, concernes him.
+PRINCE
What's the matter?
BAST
Meanes your Lordship to be
married to morrow?
+PRINCE
You know he does.
BAST
I know not that when he knowes what I know.
+CLAUDIO
If there be any impediment, I pray you discouer
it.
BAST
You may thinke I loue you not, let that appeare
hereafter, and ayme better at me by that I now will
manifest, for my brother [I thinke, he holds you well,
and in dearenesse of heart] hath holpe to effect your ensuing
marriage: surely sute ill spent, and labour ill bestowed.
+PRINCE
Why, what's the matter?
BASTARD
I came hither to tell you, and circumstances
shortned, [for she hath beene too long a talking of] the
Lady is disloyall.
+CLAUDIO
Who Hero?
BAST
Euen shee, Leonatoes Hero, your Hero, euery
mans Hero.
+CLAUDIO
Disloyall?
BAST
The word is too good to paint out her wickednesse,
I could say she were worse, thinke you of a worse
title, and I will fit her to it: wonder not till further
warrant: goe but with mee to night, you shal see her
chamber window entred, euen the night before her
wedding day, if you loue her, then to morrow wed her:
But it would better fit your honour to change your minde.
+CLAUDIO
May this be so?
+PRINCE
I will not thinke it.
BAST
If you dare not trust that you see, confesse not
that you know: if you will follow mee, I will shew you
enough, and when you haue seene more, & heard more,
proceed accordingly.
+CLAUDIO
If I see any thing to night, why I should not
marry her to morrow in the congregation, where I
shold wedde, there will I shame her.
+PRINCE
And as I wooed for thee to obtaine her, I will
ioyne with thee to disgrace her.
BAST
I will disparage her no farther, till you are my
witnesses, beare it coldly but till night, and let the
issue shew it selfe.
+PRINCE
O day vntowardly turned!
+CLAUDIO
O mischiefe strangelie thwarting!
BASTARD
O plague right well preuented! so will you say,
when you haue seene the sequele.
SD: +Bastard exits.




NS: Act 3 Scene 3

SD: Enter +DOGBERRY and his compartner with the watch.

+DOGBERRY
Are you good men and true?

+VERGES
Yea, or else it were pitty but they should suffer
saluation body and soule.

+DOGBERRY
Nay, that were a punishment too good for
them, if they should haue any allegiance in them, being
chosen for the Princes watch.

+VERGES
Well, giue them their charge, neighbour
Dogbery.

+DOGBERRY
First, who thinke you the most desartlesse man
to be Constable?

+WATCH1
Hugh Ote-cake sir, or George Sea-coale,
for they can write and reade.

+DOGBERRY
Come hither neighbour Sea-coale, God hath
blest you with a good name: to be a wel-fauoured man,
is the gift of Fortune, but to write and reade, comes
by Nature.

+WATCH2
Both which Master Constable

+DOGBERRY
You haue: I knew it would be your answere:
well, for your fauour sir, why giue God thankes, &
make no boast of it, and for your writing and reading,
let that appeare when there is no need of such vanity, you
are thought heere to be the most senslesse and fit man
for the Constable of the watch: therefore beare you the
lanthorne: this is your charge: You shall comprehend all
vagrom men, you are to bid any man stand in the
Princes name.

+WATCH2
How if a will not stand?

+DOGBERRY
Why then take no note of him, but let him go,
and presently call the rest of the Watch together, and
thanke God you are ridde of a knaue.

+VERGES
If he will not stand when he is bidden, hee is none
of the Princes subiects.

+DOGBERRY
True, and they are to meddle with none but the
Princes subiects: you shall also make no noise in the
streetes: for, for the Watch to babble and talke, is most
tollerable, and not to be indured.

+WATCH
We will rather sleepe than talke, wee
know what belongs to a Watch.

+DOGBERRY
Why you speake like an ancient and most quiet
watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend:
only haue a care that your bills be not stolne: well, you
are to call at all the Alehouses, and bid them that are
drunke get them to bed.

+WATCH
How if they will not?

+DOGBERRY
Why then let them alone till they are sober,
if they make you not then the better answere, you may
say, they are not the men you tooke them for.

+WATCH
Well sir.

+DOGBERRY
If you meet a theefe, you may suspect him, by
vertue of your office, to be no true man: and for such
kinde of men, the lesse you meddle or make with them,
why the more is for your honesty.

+WATCH
If wee know him to be a thiefe, shall
wee not lay hands on him.

+DOGBERRY
Truly by your office you may, but I think
they that touch pitch will be defil'd: the most peaceable
way for you, if you doe take a theefe, is, to let him
shew himselfe what he is, and steale out of your company.

+VERGES
You haue bin alwaies cal'd a merciful mã
partner.

+DOGBERRY
Truely I would not hang a dog by my will,
much more a man who hath anie honestie in him.

+VERGES
If you heare a child crie in the night you must call
to the nurse, and bid her still it.

+WATCH
How if the nurse be asleepe and will
not heare vs?

+DOGBERRY
Why then depart in peace, and let the childe
wake her with crying, for the ewe that will not heare her
Lambe when it baes, will neuer answere a calfe when he
bleates.

+VERGES
'Tis verie true.

+DOGBERRY
This is the end of the charge: you constable
are to present the Princes owne person, if you meete the
Prince in the night, you may staie him.

+VERGES
Nay birladie that I thinke a cannot.

+DOGBERRY
Fiue shillings to one on't with anie man that
knowes the Statutes, he may staie him, marrie not without
the prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to
offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a man against
his will.

+VERGES
Birladie I thinke it be so.

+DOGBERRY
Ha, ah ha, well masters good night, and
there be anie matter of weight chances, call vp me, keepe
your fellowes counsailes, and your owne, and good night,
come neighbour.
+DOGBERRY exits

+WATCH
Well masters, we heare our charge,
let vs go sit here vpon the Church bench till two, and
then all to bed.

+DOGBERRY
One word more, honest neighbors.
I pray
you watch about signior Leonatoes doore, for the wedding
being there to morrow, there is a great coyle to night,
adiew, be vigitant I beseech you.
+DOGBERRY, +VERGES, +WATCH exits

SD: Enter +BORACHIO and +CONRADE.

+BORACHIO
What, Conrade?

+WATCH
Peace, stir not.

+BORACHIO
Conrade I say.

+CONRADE
Here man, I am at thy elbow.

+BORACHIO
Mas and my elbow itcht, I thought there
would a scabbe follow.

+CONRADE
I will owe thee an answere for that, and now
forward with thy tale.

+BORACHIO
Stand thee close then vnder this penthouse,
for it drissels raine, and I will, like a true drunkard,
vtter all to thee.

+WATCH
Some treason masters, yet
stand close.

+BORACHIO
Therefore know, I haue earned of Don Iohn a
thousand Ducates.

+CONRADE
Is it possible that anie villanie should be so deare?

+BORACHIO
Thou should'st rather aske if it were possible
anie villanie should be so rich? for when rich villains
haue neede of poore ones, poore ones may make what price
they will.

+CONRADE
I wonder at it.

+BORACHIO
That shewes thou art vnconfirm'd, thou
knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a
cloake, is nothing to a man.

+CONRADE
Yes, it is apparell.

+BORACHIO
I meane the fashion.

+CONRADE
Yes the fashion is the fashion.

+BORACHIO
Tush, I may as well say the foole's the foole, but
seest thou not what a deformed theefe this fashion is?

+WATCH
I know that deformed, a has
bin a vile theefe, this vii. yeares, a goes vp and downe
like a gentle man: I remember his name.

+BORACHIO
Did'st thou not heare some bodie?

+CONRADE
No, 'twas the vaine on the house.

+BORACHIO
Seest thou not [I say] what a deformed thiefe
this fashion is, how giddily a turnes about all the
Hotblouds, betweene foureteene & fiue & thirtie, sometimes
fashioning them like Pharaoes souldiours in the
rechie painting, sometime like god Bels priests in the
old Church window, sometime like the shauen Hercules
in the smircht worm eaten tapestrie, where his cod-peece
seemes as massie as his club.

+CONRADE
All this I see, and see that the fashion weares
out more apparrell then the man; but art not thou thy selfe
giddie with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out
of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?

+BORACHIO
Not so neither, but know that I haue to night
wooed Margaret the Lady Heroes gentle-woman, by the
name of Hero, she leanes me out at her mistris
chamber-window, bids me a thousand times
good night: I tell this tale vildly.
I should first tell thee how
the Prince Claudio and my Master planted, and
placed, and possessed by my Master Don Iohn, saw a far
off in the Orchard this amiable incounter.

+CONRADE
And thought thy Margaret was Hero?

+BORACHIO
Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio, but
the diuell my Master knew she was Margaret and partly
by his oathes, which first possest them, partly by the
darke night which did deceiue them, but chiefely, by my
villanie, which did confirme any slander that Don Iohn
had made, away went Claudio enraged, swore hee would
meete her as he was apointed next morning at the
Temple, and there, before the whole congregation shame
her with what he saw o're night, and send her home
againe without a husband.

+WATCH1
We charge you in the Princes name
stand.

+WATCH2
Call vp the right master Constable,
we haue here recouered the most dangerous peece of
lechery, that euer was knowne in the Common-wealth.

+WATCH1
And one Deformed is one of them,
I know him, a weares a locke.

+CONRADE
Masters, masters.

+WATCH2
Youle be made bring deformed
forth I warrant you,

+CONRADE
Masters, neuer speake, we charge you, let vs
obey you to goe with vs.

+BORACHIO
We are like to proue a goodly commoditie,
being taken vp of these mens bils.

+CONRADE
A commoditie in question I warrant you, come
weele obey you.

No pray thee good Meg, Ile weare this.

+MARGARET
By my troth's not so good, and I warrant
your cosin will say so.

+HERO
My cosin's a foole, and thou art another, ile weare
none but this.

+MARGARET
I like the new tire within excellently, if the
haire were a thought browner: and your gown's a most
rare fashion yfaith, I saw the Dutchesse of Millaines gowne
that they praise so.

+HERO
O that exceedes they say.

+MARGARET
By my troth's but a night-gowne in respect of
yours, cloth a gold and cuts, and lac'd withsiluer, set
with pearles, downe sleeues, side sleeues, and skirts, round
vnderborn with a blewish tinsel, but for a fine queint
gracefull and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on't.

God giue mee ioy to weare it, for my heart is exceeding
heauy.

+MARGARET
'Twill be heauier soone, by the waight of a man.

+HERO
Fie vpon thee, art not asham'd?

+MARGARET
Of what Lady? of speaking honourably? is
not marriage honourable in a beggar? is not your Lord
honourable without marriage? I thinke you would haue
me say, sauing your reuerence a husband: and bad
thinking doe not wrest true speaking, Ile offend no body,
is there any harme in the heauier for a husband? none
I thinke, and it be the right husband, and the right wife,
otherwise 'tis light and not heauy, aske my Lady
Beatrice else, here she comes.

SD: Enter +BEATRICE.

+HERO
Good morrow Coze.

+BEATRICE
Good morrow sweet Hero.

+HERO
Why how now? do you speake in the sick tune?

+BEATRICE
I am out of all other tune, me thinkes.

+MARGARET
Claps into Light a loue, [that goes without a
burden,] do you sing it and Ile dance it.

+BEATRICE
Ye Light aloue with your heeles, then if your
husband haue stables enough, you'll looke he shall lacke no
barnes.

+MARGARET
O illegitimate construction! I scorne that with
my heeles.

+BEATRICE
'Tis almost fiue a clocke cosin, 'tis time you

+MARGARET
For a hauke, a horse, or a husband?

+BEATRICE
For the letter that begins them all, H.

+MARGARET
Well, and you be not turn'd Turke, there's no
more sayling by the starre.

+BEATRICE
What meanes the foole trow?

+MARGARET
Nothing I, but God send euery one their

These gloues the Count sent mee, they are an excellent
perfume.

+BEATRICE
I am stuft cosin, I cannot smell.

+MARGARET
A maid and stuft! there's goodly catching
of colde.

+BEATRICE
O God helpe me, God help me, how long haue
you profest apprehension?

+MARGARET
Euer since you left it, doth not my wit
become me rarely?

+BEATRICE
It is not seene enough, you should weare it in

+MARGARET
Get you some of this distill'd carduus benedictus
and lay it to your heart, it is the onely thing for a
qualm.

+HERO
There thou prickst her with a thissell.

+BEATRICE
Benedictus, why benedictus? you haue some
morall in this benedictus.

+MARGARET
Morall? no by my troth, I haue no morall
meaning, I meant plaine holy thissell, you may thinke perchance
that I thinke you are in loue, nay birlady I
am not such a foole to thinke what I list, nor I list not to
thinke what I can, nor indeed I cannot thinke, if I would
thinke my hart out of thinking, that you are in loue, or
that you will be in loue, or that you can be in loue: yet
Benedicke was such another, and now is he become a
man, he swore hee would neuer marry, and yet now in
despight of his heart he eates his meat without grudging,
and how you may be conuerted I know not, but me thinkes
you looke with your eies as other women doe.

Goodman Verges sir speakes a little of the

Yes I thank God, I am as honest as any man liuing,
that is an old man, and no honester then I.

NS: Act 4, Scene 1

SD: Enter +Prince, +Bastard, +Leonato, +Frier, +Claudio, +Benedicke, +Hero, and +Beatrice.

+LEONATO
Come Frier Francis, be briefe, onely to the plaine
forme of marriage, and you shal recount their particular
duties afterwards.

+FRIER
You come hither, my Lord, to marry this Lady.

+CLAUDIO
No.

+LEONATO
To be married to her: Frier, you come to marrie
her.

+FRIER
Lady, you come hither to be married to this Count.

+HERO
I doe.

+FRIER
If either of you know any inward impediment why
you should not be conioyned, I charge you on your soules
to vtter it.

+CLAUDIO
Know you anie, Hero?

+HERO
None my Lord.

+FRIER
Know you anie, Count?

+LEONATO
I dare make his answer, None.

+CLAUDIO
O what men dare do! what men may do!
what men daily do!

+BENEDICKE
How now! interiections? why then, some be
of laughing, as ha, ha, he.

+CLAUDIO
Stand thee by Frier, father, by your leaue,
Will you with free and vnconstrained soule
Giue me this maid your daughter?

+LEONATO
As freely sonne as God did giue her me.

+CLAUDIO
And what haue I to giue you back, whose worth
May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?

+PRINCE
Nothing, vnlesse you render her againe.

+CLAUDIO
Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulnes:
There Leonato, take her backe againe,
Giue not this rotten Orenge to your friend,
Shee's but the signe and semblance of her honour:
Behold how like a maid she blushes heere!
O what authoritie and shew of truth
Can cunning sinne couer it selfe withall!
Comes not that bloud, as modest euidence,
To witnesse simple Vertue? would you not sweare
All you that see her, that she were a maide,
By these exterior shewes? But she is none:
She knowes the heat of a luxurious bed:
Her blush is guiltinesse, not modestie.

+LEONATO
What doe you meane, my Lord?

+CLAUDIO
Not to be married,
Not to knit my soule to an approued wanton.

+LEONATO
Deere my Lord, if you in your owne proofe,
Haue vanquisht the resistance of her youth,
And made defeat of her virginitie.

+CLAUDIO
I know what you would say: if I haue knowne her,
You will say, she did imbrace me as a husband,
And so extenuate the forehand sinne:
No Leonato,
I neuer tempted her with word too large,
But as a brother to his sister, shewed
Bashfull sinceritie and comely loue.

+HERO
And seem'd I euer otherwise to you?

+CLAUDIO
Out on thee seeming, I will write against it,
You seeme to me as Diane in her Orbe,
As chaste as is the budde ere it be blowne:
But you are more intemperate in your blood,
Than Venus, or those pampred animalls,
That rage in sauage sensualitie.

+HERO
Is my Lord well, that he doth speake so wide?

+LEONATO
Sweete Prince, why speake not you?

+PRINCE
What should I speake?
I stand dishonour'd that haue gone about,
To linke my deare friend to a common stale.

+LEONATO
Are these things spoken, or doe I but dreame?

+BASTARD
Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.

+BENEDICKE
This lookes not like a nuptiall.

+HERO
True, O God!

+CLAUDIO
Leonato, stand I here?
Is this the Prince? is this the Princes brother?
Is this face Heroes? are our eies our owne?

+LEONATO
All this is so, but what of this my Lord?

+CLAUDIO
Let me but moue one question to your daughter,
And by that fatherly and kindly power,
That you haue in her, bid her answer truly.

+LEONATO
I charge thee doe, as thou art my childe.

+HERO
O God defend me how am I beset,
What kinde of catechizing call you this?

+CLAUDIO
To make you answer truly to your name.

+HERO
Is it not Hero? who can blot that name
With any iust reproach?

+CLAUDIO
Marry that can Hero,
Hero it selfe can blot out Heroes vertue.
What man was he, talkt with you yesternight,
Out at your window betwixt twelue and one?
Now if you are a maid, answer to this.

+HERO
I talkt with no man at that howre my Lord.

+PRINCE
Why then you are no maiden. Leonato,
I am sorry you must heare: vpon mine honor,
My selfe, my brother, and this grieued Count
Did see her, heare her, at that howre last night,
Talke with a ruffian at her chamber window,
Who hath indeed most like a liberall villaine,
Confest the vile encounters they haue had
A thousand times in secret.

+BASTARD
Fie, fie, they are not to be named my Lord,
Not to be spoken of,
There is not chastitie enough in language,
Without offence to vtter them: thus pretty Lady
I am sorry for thy much misgouernment.

+CLAUDIO
O Hero! what a Hero hadst thou beene
If halfe thy outward graces had beene placed
About thy thoughts and counsailes of thy heart?
But fare thee well, most foule, most faire, farewell
Thou pure impiety, and impious puritie,
For thee Ile locke vp all the gates of Loue,
And on my eie-lids shall Coniecture hang,
To turne all beauty into thoughts of harme,
And neuer shall it more be gracious.

+LEONATO
Hath no mans dagger here a point for me?

+BEATRICE
Why how now cosin, wherfore sink you down?

+BASTARD
Come, let vs go: these things come thus to light,
Smother her spirits vp.

+BENEDICKE
How doth the Lady?

+BEATRICE
Dead I thinke, helpe vncle,
Hero, why Hero, Vncle, Signor Benedicke, Frier.

+LEONATO
O Fate! take not away thy heauy hand,
Death is the fairest couer for her shame
That may be wisht for.

+BEATRICE
How now cosin Hero?

+FRIER
Haue comfort Ladie.

+LEONATO
Dost thou looke vp?

+FRIER
Yea, wherefore should she not?

+LEONATO
Wherfore? Why doth not euery earthly thing
Cry shame vpon her? Could she heere denie
The storie that is printed in her blood?
Do not liue Hero, do not ope thine eyes:
For did I thinke thou wouldst not quickly die,
Thought I thy spirits were stronger then thy shames,
My selfe would on the reward of reproaches
Strike at thy life. Grieu'd I, I had but one?
Chid I, for that at frugal Natures frame?
O one too much by thee: why had I one?
Why euer was't thou louelie in my eies?
Why had I not with charitable hand
Tooke vp a beggars issue at my gates,
Who smeered thus, and mir'd with infamie,
I might haue said, no part of it is mine:
This shame deriues it selfe from vnknowne loines,
But mine, and mine I lou'd, and mine I prais'd,
And mine that I was proud on mine so much,
That I my selfe, was to my selfe not mine:
Valewing of her, why she, O she is falne
Into a pit of Inke, that the wide sea
Hath drops too few to wash her cleane againe,
And salt too little, which may season giue
To her foule tainted flesh.

+BENEDICKE
Sir, sir, be patient:
for my part, I am so attired
in wonder, I know not what to say.

+BEATRICE
O on my soule my cosin is belied.

+BENEDICKE
Ladie, were you her bedfellow last night?

+BEATRICE
No truly: not although vntill last night,
I haue this tweluemonth bin her bedfellow.

+LEONATO
Confirm'd, confirm'd, O that is stronger made
Which was before barr'd vp with ribs of iron.
Would the Princes lie, and Claudio lie,
Who lou'd her so, that speaking of her foulnesse,
Wash'd it with teares? Hence from her, let her die.

+FRIER
Heare me a little,
for I haue onely bene silent so long,
and giuen way vnto this course of fortune,
by noting of the Ladie, I haue markt.
A thousand blushing apparitions,
To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames,
In Angel whitenesse beare away those blushes,
And in her eie there hath appear'd a fire
To burne the errors that these Princes hold
Against her maiden truth. Call me a foole,
Trust not my reading, nor my obseruations,
Which with experimental seale doth warrant
The tenure of my booke: trust not my age,
My reuerence, calling, nor diuinitie,
If this sweet Ladie lye not guiltlesse heere,
Vnder some biting error.

+LEONATO
Friar, it cannot be:
Thou seest that all the Grace that she hath left,
Is, that she wil not adde to her damnation,
A sinne of periury, she not denies it:
Why seek'st thou then to couer with excuse,
That which appeares in proper nakednesse?

+FRIER
Ladie, what man is he you are accus'd of?

+HERO
They know that do accuse me, I know none:
If I know more of any man aliue
Then that which maiden modestie doth warrant,
Let all my sinnes lacke mercy. O my Father,
Proue you that any man with me conuerst,
At houres vnmeete, or that I yesternight
Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death.

+FRIER
There is some strange misprision in the Princes.

+BENEDICKE
Two of them haue the verie bent of honor,
And if their wisedomes be misled in this:
The practise of it liues in Iohn the bastard,
Whose spirits toile in frame of villanies.

+LEONATO
I know not: if they speake but truth of her,
These hands shall teare her: If they wrong her honour,
The proudest of them shall wel heare of it.
Time hath not yet so dried this bloud of mine,
Nor age so eate vp my inuention,
Nor Fortune made such hauocke of my meanes,
Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
But they shall finde, awak'd in such a kinde,
Both strength of limbe, and policie of minde,
Ability in meanes, and choise of friends,
To quit me of them throughly.

+FRIER
Pause awhile:
And let my counsell sway you in this case,
Your daughter heere the Princesse [left for dead]
Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
And publish it, that she is dead indeed:
Maintaine a mourning ostentation,
And on your Families old monument,
Hang mournfull Epitaphes, and do all rites,
That appertaine vnto a buriall.

+LEONATO
What shall become of this? What wil this do?

+FRIER
Marry this wel carried, shall on her behalfe,
Change slander to remorse, that is some good,
But not for that dreame I on this strange course,
But on this trauaile looke for greater birth:
She dying, as it must be so maintain'd,
Vpon the instant that she was accus'd,
Shal be lamented, pittied, and excus'd
Of euery hearer: for it so fals out,
That what we haue, we prize not to the worth,
Whiles we enioy it; but being lack'd and lost,
Why then we racke the value, then we finde
The vertue that possession would not shew vs
Whiles it was ours, so will it fare with Claudio:
When he shal heare she dyed vpon his words,
Th'Idea of her life shal sweetly creepe
Into his study of imagination.
And euery louely Organ of her life,
Shall come apparel'd in more precious habite:
More mouing delicate, and ful of life,
Into the eye and prospect of his soule
Then when she liu'd indeed: then shal he mourne,
If euer Loue had interest in his Liuer,
And wish he had not so accused her:
No, though he thought his accusation true:
Let this be so, and doubt not but successe
Wil fashion the euent in better shape,
Then I can lay it downe in likelihood.
But if all ayme but this be leuelld false,
The supposition of the Ladies death,
Will quench the wonder of her infamie.
And if it sort not well, you may conceale her,
As best befits her wounded reputation,
In some reclusiue and religious life,
Out of all eyes, tongnes, mindes and iniuries.

+BENEDICKE
Signior Leonato, let the Frier aduise you,
And though you know my inwardnesse and loue
Is very much vnto the Prince and Claudio.
Yet, by mine honor, I will deale in this,
As secretly and iustlie, as your soule
Should with your bodie.

+LEONATO
Being that I flow in greefe,
The smallest twine may lead me.

+FRIER
'Tis well consented, presently away,
For to strange sores, strangely they straine the cure,
Come Lady, die to liue, this wedding day
Perhaps is but prolong'd, haue patience & endure.

May a man doe it?

As strange as the thing I know not, it were as
possible for me to say, I loued nothing so well as you, but
beleeue me not, and yet I lie not, I confesse nothing, nor I
deny nothing, I am sorry for my cousin.

Doe not sweare by it and eat it.

With no sawce that can be deuised to it, I protest
I loue thee.

+BEATRICE
Why then God forgiue me.

+BENEDICKE
What offence sweet Beatrice?

+BEATRICE
You haue stayed me in a happy howre, I was
about to protest I loued you.

+BENEDICKE
And doe it with all thy heart.

+BEATRICE
I loue you with so much of my heart, that none
is left to protest.

+BENEDICKE
Come, bid me doe any thing for thee.

Kill Claudio.

Ha, not for the wide world.

You kill me to denie, farewell.

+BEATRICE
In faith I will goe.

+BENEDICKE
Wee'll be friends first.

+BEATRICE
You dare easier be friends with mee, than fight
with mine enemy.

+BENEDICKE
Is Claudio thine enemie?

+BEATRICE
Is a not approued in the height a villaine, that
hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman?
O that I were a man! what, beare her in hand vntill they
come to take hands, and then with publike accusation
vncouered slander, vnmittigated rancour? O God that
I were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place.

+BENEDICKE
Heare me Beatrice.

+BEATRICE
Talke with a man out at a window, a proper
saying.

+BENEDICKE
Nay but Beatrice.

+BEATRICE
Sweet Hero, she is wrong'd, shee is slandered,
she is vndone.

+BENEDICKE
Beat?

+BEATRICE
Princes and Counties! surelie a Princely testimonie,
a goodly Count, Comfect, a sweet Gallant
surelie, O that I were a man for his sake! or that I had
any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood
is melted into cursies, valour into complement, and
men are onelie turned into tongue, and trim ones too: he
is now as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie, and
sweares it: I cannot be a man with wishing, therfore I
will die a woman with grieuing.

+BENEDICKE
Tarry good Beatrice, by this hand I loue
thee.

+BEATRICE
Vse it for my loue some other way then swearing
by it.

+BENEDICKE
Thinke you in your soule the Count Claudio hath
wrong'd Hero?

+BEATRICE
Yea, as sure as I haue a thought, or a soule.

+BENEDICKE
Enough, I am engagde, I will challenge him,
I will kisse your hand, and so leaue you: by this hand
Claudio shall render me a deere account: as you heare of
me, so thinke of me: goe comfort your coosin, I must say
she is dead, and so farewell.

SD: Enter +LEONATO and his brother.
+BROTHER
If you goe on thus, you will kill your selfe,
And 'tis not wisedome thus to second griefe,
Against your selfe.

+LEONATO
I pray thee cease thy counsaile,
Which falls into mine eares as profitlesse,
As water in a siue: giue not me counsaile,
Nor let no comfort delight mine eare,
But such a one whose wrongs doth sute with mine.
Bring me a father that so lou'd his childe,
Whose ioy of her is ouer-whelmed like mine,
And bid him speake of patience,
Measure his woe the length and bredth of mine,
And let it answere euery straine for straine,
As thus for thus, and such a griefe for such,
In euery lineament, branch, shape, and forme:
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
And sorrow, wagge, crie hem, when he should grone,
Patch griefe with prouerbs, make misfortune drunke,
With candle-wasters: bring him yet to me,
And I of him will gather patience:
But there is no such man, for brother, men
Can counsaile, and speake comfort to that griefe,
Which they themselues not feele, but tasting it,
Their counsaile turnes to passion, which before,
Would giue preceptiall medicine to rage,
Fetter strong madnesse in a silken thred,
Charme ache with ayre, and agony with words,
No, no, 'tis all mens office, to speake patience
To those that wring vnder the load of sorrow:
But no mans vertue nor sufficiencie
To be so morall, when he shall endure
The like himselfe: therefore giue me no counsaile,
My griefs cry lowder then aduertisement.

+BROTHER
Therein do men from children nothing differ.

+LEONATO
I pray thee peace, I will be flesh and bloud,
For there was neuer yet Philosopher,
That could endure the tooth-ake patiently,
How euer they haue writ the stile of gods,
And made a push at chance and sufferance.

+BROTHER
Yet bend not all the harme vpon your selfe,
Make those that doe offend you, suffer too.

+LEONATO
There thou speak'st reason, nay I will doe so,
My soule doth tell me, Hero is belied,
And that shall +CLAUDIO know, so shall the +PRINCE,
And all of them that thus dishonour her.

Infaith my hand meant nothing to my sword.

Thou hast so wrong'd my innocent childe and me,
That I am forc'd to lay my reuerence by,
And with grey haires and bruise of many daies,
Doe challenge thee to triall of a man,
I say thou hast belied mine innocent childe.
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
And she lies buried with her ancestors:

Boyes, apes, braggarts, Iackes, milke-sops.

+LEONATO
Brother Anthony.

+BROTHER
Hold you content, what man? I know them, yea
And what they weigh, euen to the vtmost scruple,
Scambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boyes,
That lye, and cog, and flout, depraue, and slander,
Goe antiquely, and show outward hidiousnesse,
And speake of halfe a dozen dang'rous words,
How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst.
And this is all.

+LEONATO
But brother Anthonie.

+BROTHER
Come, 'tis no matter,
Do not you meddle, let me deale in this.

+PRINCE
Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience
My heart is sorry for your daughters death:
But on my honour she was charg'd with nothing
But what was true, and very full of proofe.

+LEONATO
My Lord, my Lord.

+PRINCE
I will not heare you.

+LEONATO
No
come brother, away, I will be heard.
LEONATO exits, BROTHER exits
+BROTHER
And shall, or some of vs will smart for it.

+PRINCE
See, see, here comes the man we went to seeke.

SD: Enter +BENEDICK.
+CLAUDIO
Now signior, what newes?

+BENEDICK
Good day my Lord.

+PRINCE
Welcome signior, you are almost come to
part almost a fray.

+CLAUDIO
Wee had likt to haue had our two noses snapt
off with two old men without teeth.

+PRINCE
+LEONATO and his brother, what think'st thou?
had wee fought, I doubt we should haue beene too yong
for them.

+BENEDICK
In a false quarrell there is no true valour, I
came to seeke you both.

+CLAUDIO
We haue beene vp and downe to seeke thee, for we
are high proofe melancholly, and would faine haue it
beaten away, wilt thou vse thy wit?

+BENEDICK
It is in my scabberd, shall I draw it?

+PRINCE
Doest thou weare thy wit by thy side?

+CLAUDIO
Neuer any did so, though verie many haue been
beside their wit, I will bid thee drawe, as we do the
minstrels, draw to pleasure vs.

+PRINCE
As I am an honest man he lookes pale,
art thou sicke, or angrie?

+CLAUDIO
What, courage man: what though care kil'd
a cat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.

+BENEDICK
Sir, I shall meete your wit in the careere, and you
charge it against me, I pray you chuse another subiect.

+CLAUDIO
Nay then giue him another staffe, this last was
broke crosse.

+PRINCE
By this light, he changes more and more, I
thinke he be angrie indeede.

+CLAUDIO
If he be, he knowes how to turne his girdle.

+BENEDICK
Shall I speake a word in your eare?

+CLAUDIO
God blesse me from a challenge.

+BENEDICK
You are a villaine, I iest not,
I will make it good how you dare, with what you dare,
and when you dare: do me right, or I will protest your
cowardise: you haue kill'd a sweete Ladie, and her death
shall fall heauie on you, let me heare from you.

+CLAUDIO
Well, I will meete you, so I may haue good cheare.

+PRINCE
What, a feast, a feast?

+CLAUDIO
I faith I thanke him, he hath bid me to a calues
head and a Capon, the which if I doe not carue most
curiously, say my knife's naught, shall I not finde a
wood-cocke too?

+BENEDICK
Sir, your wit ambles well, it goes easily.

+PRINCE
Ile tell thee how Beatrice prais'd thy wit the
other day: I said thou hadst a fine wit: true saies she,
a fine little one: no said I, a great wit: right saies
shee, a great grosse one: nay said I, a good wit: iust
said she, it hurts no body: nay said I, the gentleman
is wise: certain said she, a wise gentleman: nay
said I, he hath the tongues: that I beleeue said shee,
for hee swore a thing to me on munday night, which he
forswore on tuesday morning: there's a double
tongue, there's two tongues: thus did shee an howre
together trans-shape thy particular vertues, yet at last
she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proprest man
in Italie.

+CLAUDIO
For the which she wept heartily, and said shee
car'd not.

+PRINCE
Yea that she did, but yet for all that, and if
shee did not hate him deadlie, shee would loue him dearely,
the old mans daughter told vs all.

+CLAUDIO
All, all, and moreouer, God saw him when he
was hid in the garden.

+PRINCE
But when shall we set the sauage Bulls
hornes on the sensible Benedicks head?

+CLAUDIO
Yea and text vnder-neath, heere dwells +BENEDICK
the married man.

+BENEDICK
Fare you well, Boy, you know my minde, I will
leaue you now to your gossep-like humor, you breake
iests as braggards do their blades, which God be
thanked hurt not: my Lord, for your
manie courtesies I thank you, I must discontinue your
companie, your brother the Bastard is fled from
Messina: you haue among you, kill'd a sweet and innocent
Ladie: for my Lord Lackebeard there, he and I shall
meete, and till then peace be with him.

+PRINCE
He is in earnest.

+CLAUDIO
In most profound earnest, and Ile warrant
you, for the loue of Beatrice.

+PRINCE
And hath challeng'd thee.

+CLAUDIO
Most sincerely.

+PRINCE
What a prettie thing man is, when he goes in
his doublet and hose, and leaues off his wit.

+CLAUDIO
He is then a Giant to an Ape, but then is an Ape
a Doctor to such a man.

+PRINCE
But soft you, let me be, plucke vp my heart,
and be sad, did he not say my brother was fled?

SD: Enter +CONSTABLE, +CONRADE, and +BORACHIO.
+CONSTABLE
Come you sir, if iustice cannot tame you, shee
shall nere weigh more reasons in her ballance, nay, and
you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be lookt to.

+PRINCE
How now, two of my brothers men bound?
+BORACHIO one.

+CLAUDIO
Harken after their offence my Lord.

+PRINCE
Officers, what offence haue these men done?

+CONSTABLE
Marrie sir, they haue committed false report,
moreouer they haue spoken vntruths, secondarily they
are slanders, sixt and lastly, they haue belyed a Ladie,
thirdly, they haue verified vniust things, and to conclude
they are lying knaues.

+PRINCE
First I aske thee what they haue done, thirdlie
I aske thee what's their offence, sixt and lastlie why
they are committed, and to conclude, what you lay to
their charge.

+CLAUDIO
Rightlie reasoned, and in his owne diuision, and
by my troth there's one meaning well suted.

+PRINCE
Who haue you offended masters, that you
are thus bound to your answer? this learned Constable
is too cunning to be vnderstood, what's your offence?

+BORACHIO
Sweete Prince, let me go no farther to mine
answere: do you heare me, and let this Count kill mee: I
haue deceiued euen your verie eies: what your wisedomes
could not discouer, these shallow fooles haue brought to
light, who in the night ouerheard me confessing to this
man, how Don Iohn your brother incensed me to slander
the Ladie Hero, how you were brought into the Orchard,
and saw me court Margaret in Heroes garments, how
you disgrac'd her when you should marrie her: my villanie
they haue vpon record, which I had rather seale
with my death, then repeate ouer to my shame: the Ladie
is dead vpon mine and my masters false accusation: and
briefelie, I desire nothing but the reward of a villaine.

+PRINCE
Runs not this speech like yron through your bloud?

+CLAUDIO
I haue drunke poison whiles he vtter'd it.

+PRINCE
But did my Brother set thee on to this?

+BORACHIO
Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.

+PRINCE
He is compos'd and fram'd of treacherie,
And fled he is vpon this villanie.

+CLAUDIO
Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appeare
In the rare semblance that I lou'd it first.

+CONSTABLE
Come, bring away the plaintiffes, by this time
our Sexton hath reformed Signior +LEONATO of the matter:
and masters, do not forget to specifie when time &
place shall serue, that I am an Asse.

+CONRADE
Here, here comes master Signior +LEONATO, and
the Sexton too.

SD: Enter +LEONATO.
+LEONATO
Which is the villaine? let me see his eies,
That when I note another man like him,
I may auoide him: which of these is he?

+BORACHIO
If you would know your wronger, looke on me.

+LEONATO
Art thou thou the slaue that with thy breath hast kild
mine innocent childe?

+BORACHIO
Yea, euen I alone.

+LEONATO
No, not so villaine, thou beliest thy selfe,
Here stand a paire of honourable men,
A third is fled that had a hand in it:
I thanke you Princes for my daughters death,
Record it with your high and worthie deedes,
'Twas brauely done, if you bethinke you of it.

+CLAUDIO
I know not how to pray your patience,
Yet I must speake, choose your reuenge your selfe,
Impose me to what penance your inuention
Can lay vpon my sinne, yet sinn'd I not,
But in mistaking.

+PRINCE
By my soule nor I,
And yet to satisfie this good old man,
I would bend vnder anie heauie waight,
That heele enioyne me to.

+LEONATO
I cannot bid you bid my daughter liue,
That were impossible, but I praie you both,
Possesse the people in Messina here,
How innocent she died, and if your loue
Can labour aught in sad inuention,
Hang her an epitaph vpon her toomb,
And sing it to her bones, sing it to night:
To morrow morning come you to my house,
And since you could not be my sonne in law,
Be yet my Nephew: my brother hath a daughter,
Almost the copie of my childe that's dead,
And she alone is heire to both of vs,
Giue her the right you should haue giu'n her cosin,
And so dies my reuenge.

+CLAUDIO
O noble sir!
Your ouerkindnesse doth wring teares from me,
I do embrace your offer, and dispose
For henceforth of poore +CLAUDIO.

+LEONATO
To morrow then I will expect your comming,
To night I take my leaue, this naughtie man
Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
Who I beleeue was packt in all this wrong,
Hired to it by your brother.

+BORACHIO
No by my soule she was not,
Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,
But alwaies hath bin iust and vertuous,
In anie thing that I do know by her.

+CONSTABLE
Moreouer sir, which indeede is not vnder
white and black, this plaintiffe here, the offendour did call
mee asse, I beseech you let it be remembred in his
punishment, and also the watch heard them talke of one
Deformed, they say he weares a key in his eare and a lock
hanging by it, and borrowes monie in Gods name, the
which he hath vs'd so long, and neuer paied, that now
men grow hard-harted and will lend nothing for Gods
sake: praie you examine him vpon that point.

+LEONATO
I thanke thee for thy care and honest paines.

+CONSTABLE
Your worship speakes like a most thankefull and
reuerend youth, and I praise God for you.

+LEONATO
There's for thy paines.

+CONSTABLE
God saue the foundation.

+LEONATO
Goe, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I
thanke thee.

+CONSTABLE
I leaue an arrant knaue with your worship,
which I beseech your worship to correct your selfe, for the
example of others: God keepe your worship, I wish your
worship well, God restore you to health, I humblie giue
you leaue to depart, and if a merrie meeting may be
wisht, God prohibite it: come neighbour.

+LEONATO
Vntill to morrow morning, Lords, farewell.
Exuent LEONATO, BORACHIO
+BROTHER
Farewell my Lords, we looke for you to morrow.

+PRINCE
We will not faile.

+CLAUDIO
To night ile mourne with Hero.

+LEONATO
Bring you these fellowes on, weel talke with Margaret,
how her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.
Exuent PRINCE, CLAUDIO

NS: Act 5 Scene 2

SD: Enter +BENEDICK and +MARGARET.
+BENEDICK
Praie thee sweete Mistris +MARGARET, deserue
well at my hands, by helping mee to the speech of
Beatrice.

+MARGARET
Will you then write me a Sonnet in praise of
my beautie?

+BENEDICK
In so high a stile +MARGARET, that no man liuing
shall come ouer it, for in most comely truth thou
deseruest it.

+MARGARET
To haue no man come ouer me, why, shall I
alwaies keepe below staires?

+BENEDICK
Thy wit is as quicke as the grey-hounds mouth,
it catches.

+MARGARET
And yours, as blunt as the Fencers foiles, which
hit, but hurt not.

+BENEDICK
A most manly wit +MARGARET, it will not hurt a
woman: and so I pray thee call Beatrice, I giue thee
the bucklers.

+MARGARET
Giue vs the swords, wee haue bucklers of our
owne.

+BENEDICK
If you vse them +MARGARET, you must put in
the pikes with a vice, and they are dangerous weapons
for Maides.

+MARGARET
Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I thinke
hath legges.
MARGARET exits
+BENEDICK
And therefore will come.
The God of loue
that sits aboue,
and knowes me, and knowes me,
how pittifull I deserue.
I meane in singing, but in louing, Leander the good
swimmer, Troilous the first imploier of pandars, and a
whole booke full of these quondam carpet-mongers,
whose name yet runne smoothly in the euen rode of a
blanke verse, why they were neuer so truely turned ouer
and ouer as my poore selfe in loue: marrie I cannot shew
it rime, I haue tried, I can finde out no rime to
Ladie but babie, an innocent time: for scorne,
horne, a hard time: for schoole foole, a babling
time: verie ominous endings, no, I was not borne vnder
a riming Plannet, for I cannot wooe in festiuall tearmes:

SD: Enter +BEATRICE.
+BENEDICK
sweete +BEATRICE would'st thou come when I cal'd thee?

+BEATRICE
Yea Signior, and depart when you bid me.

+BENEDICK
O stay but till then.

+BEATRICE
Then, is spoken: fare you well now, and yet
ere I goe, let me goe with that I came, which is, with knowing
what hath past betweene you and +CLAUDIO.

+BENEDICK
Onely foule words, and thereupon I will kisse thee.

+BEATRICE
Foule words is but foule wind, and foule wind is
but foule breath, and foule breath is noisome, therefore I
will depart vnkist.

+BENEDICK
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right
sence, so forcible is thy wit, but I must tell thee plainely,
+CLAUDIO vndergoes my challenge, and either I must
shortly heare from him, or I will subscribe him a coward,
and I pray thee now tell me, for which of my bad parts
didst thou first fall in loue with me?

+BEATRICE
For them all together, which maintain'd so
politique a state of euill, that they will not admit any good
part to intermingle with them: but for which of my good
parts did you first suffer loue for me?

+BENEDICK
Suffer loue! a good epithite, I do suffer loue
indeede, for I loue thee against my will.

+BEATRICE
In spight of your heart I think, alas poore
heart, if you spight it for my sake, I will spight it for yours,
for I will neuer loue that which my friend hates.

+BENEDICK
Thou and I are too wise to wooe peaceablie.

+BEATRICE
It appeares not in this confession, there's not
one wise man among twentie that will praise himselfe.

+BENEDICK
An old, an old instance +BEATRICE, that liu'd in
the time of good neighbours, if a man doe not erect in
this age his owne tombe ere he dies, hee shall liue no longer
in monuments, then the Bels ring, & the Widdow weepes.

+BEATRICE
And how long is that thinke you?

+BENEDICK
Question, why an hower in clamour and a
quarter in rhewme, therfore is it most expedient for the
wise, if Don worme [his conscience] finde no impediment
to the contrarie, to be the trumpet of his owne vertues, as
I am to my selfe so much for praising my selfe, who I
my selfe will beare witnesse is praise worthie, and now tell
me, how doth your cosin?

+BEATRICE
Verie ill.

+BENEDICK
And how doe you?

+BEATRICE
Verie ill too.

+BENEDICK
Serue God, loue me, and mend, there will I
leaue you too, for here comes one in haste.

SD: Enter +URSULA.
+URSULA
Madam, you must come to your Vncle, yonders
old coile at home, it is prooued my Ladie Hero hath bin
falselie accusde, the +PRINCE and +CLAUDIO mightilie abusde,
and Don Iohn is the author of all, who is fled and gone:
will you come presentlie?

+BEATRICE
Will you go heare this newes Signior?

+BENEDICK
I will liue in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
buried in thy eies: and moreouer, I will goe with thee to
thy Vncles.
Exuent BENEDICK, BEATRICE

foure with Tapers.

Is this the monument of +LEONATO?

+LORD
It is my Lord.
Epitaph.
Done to death by slanderous tongues,
Was the Hero that here lies:
Death in guerdon of her wrongs,
Giues her fame which neuer dies:
So the life that dyed with shame,
Liues in death with glorious fame.
Hang thou there vpon the tombe,
Praising her when I am dombe.
Now musick sound & sing your solemn hymne
Song.
Pardon goddesse of the night,
Those that slew thy virgin knight,
For the which with songs of woe,
Round about her tombe they goe:
Midnight assist our mone,
helpe vs to sigh and grone.
Heauily, heauily.
Graues yawne and yeelde your dead,
Till death be vttered,
Heauenly, heauenly.

+LORD
Now vnto thy bones good night,
yeerely will I do this right.

+PRINCE
Good morrow masters, put your Torches out,
The wolues haue preied, and looke, the gentle day
Before the wheeles of Phoebus, round about
Dapples the drowsie East with spots of grey:
Thanks to you all, and leaue vs, fare you well.

+CLAUDIO
Good morrow masters, each his seuerall way.

+PRINCE
Come let vs hence, and put on other weedes,
And then to +LEONATOes we will goe.

And Hymen now with luckier issue speeds,
Then this for whom we rendred vp this woe.

SD: Enter +LEONATO, +BENE, +MARG, +VRSULA, old man, +FRIER, +HERO.

+FRIER
Did I not tell you she was innocent?

+LEO
So are the Prince and Claudio who accus'd her,
Vpon the errour that you heard debated:
But Margaret was in some fault for this,
Although against her will as it appeares,
In the true course of all the question.

+OLD
Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.

+BENE
And so am I, being else by faith enforc'd
To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.

+LEO
Well daughter, and you gentlewomen all,
Withdraw into a chamber by your selues,
And when I send for you, come hither mask'd:
The Prince and Claudio promis'd by this howre
To visit me, you know your office Brother,
You must be father to your brothers daughter,
And giue her to young Claudio.

SD: Exeunt Ladies.

+OLD
Which I will doe with confirm'd countenance.

+BENE
Frier, I must intreat your paines, I thinke.

+FRIER
To doe what Signior?

+BENE
To binde me, or vndoe me, one of them:
Signior Leonato, truth it is good Signior,
Your neece regards me with an eye of fauour.

+LEO
That eye my daughter lent her, 'tis most true.

+BENE
And I doe with an eye of loue requite her.

+LEO
The sight whereof I thinke you had from me,
From Claudio, and the Prince, but what's your will?

+BENE
Your answer sir is Enigmaticall,
But for my will, my will is, your good will
May stand with ours, this day to be conioyn'd,
In the state of honourable marriage,
In which [good Frier] I shall desire your helpe.

+LEO
My heart is with your liking.

+FRIER
And my helpe.

SD: Enter Prince and Claudio, with attendants.

+PRIN
Good morrow to this faire assembly.

+LEO
Good morrow Prince, good morrow Claudio:
We heere attend you, are you yet determin'd,
To day to marry with my brothers daughter?

+CLAUD
Ile hold my minde were she an Ethiope.

+LEO
Call her forth brother, heres the Frier ready.

+PRIN
Good morrow Benedicke, why what's the matter?
That you haue such a Februarie face,
So full of frost, of storme, and clowdinesse.

+CLAUD
I thinke he thinkes vpon the sauage bull:
Tush, feare not man, wee'll tip thy hornes with gold,
And all Europa shall reioyce at thee,
As once Europa did at lusty Ioue,
When he would play the noble beast in loue.

+BEN
Bull Ioue sir, had an amiable low,
And some such strange bull leapt your fathers Cow,
A got a Calfe in that same noble feat,
Much like to you, for you haue iust his bleat.

+CLA
For this I owe you: here comes other recknings.
SD: Enter brother, +HERO, +BEATRICE, +MARGARET, +VRSULA.
Which is the Lady I must seize vpon?

+LEO
This same is she, and I doe giue you her.

+CLA
Why then she's mine, sweet let me see your face.

+LEONATO
No that you shal not, till you take her hand,
Before this Frier, and sweare to marry her.

+CLAU
Giue me your hand before this holy Frier,
I am your husband if you like of me.

+HERO
And when I liu'd I was your other wife,
And when you lou'd, you were my other husband.

+CLAU
Another Hero?

+HERO
Nothing certainer.
One Hero died, but I doe liue,
And surely as I liue, I am a maid.

+PRIN
The former Hero, Hero that is dead.

+LEO
Shee died my Lord, but whiles her slander liu'd.

+FRIER
All this amazement can I qualifie,
When after that the holy rites are ended,
Ile tell you largely of faire Heroes death:
Meane time let wonder seeme familiar,
And to the chappell let vs presently.

+BENE
Soft and faire Frier, which is Beatrice?

+BEAT
I answer to that name, what is your will?

+BENE
Doe not you loue me?

+BEAT
Why no, no more then reason.

+BENE
Why then your Vncle, and the Prince, & Claudio,
haue beene deceiued, they swore you did.

+BEAT
Doe not you loue mee?

+BENE
Troth no, no more then reason.

+BEAT
Why then my Cosin Margaret and Vrsula
Are much deceiu'd, for they did sweare you did.

+BENE
They swore you were almost sicke for me.

+BEAT
They swore you were wel-nye dead for me.

+BENE
'Tis no matter, then you doe not loue me?

+BEAT
No truly, but in friendly recompence.

+LEO
Come Cosin, I am sure you loue the gentlemã.

+CLAU
And Ile be sworne vpon't, that he loues her,
For heres a paper written in his hand,
A halting sonnet of his owne pure braine,
Fashioned to Beatrice.

+HERO
And heeres another,
Writ in my cosins hand, stolne from her pocket,
Containing her affection vnto Benedicke.

+BENE
A miracle, here's our owne hands against our
hearts: come I will haue thee, but by this light I take
thee for pittie.

+BEAT
I would not denie you, but by this good day, I
yeeld vpon great perswasion, & partly to saue your
life, for I was told, you were in a consumption.

+LEO
Peace I will stop your mouth.

+PRIN
How dost thou Benedicke the married man?

+BENE
Ile tell thee what Prince: a Colledge of witte-crackers
cannot flout mee out of my humour, dost thou
think I care for a Satyre or an Epigram? no, if a man will
be beaten with braines, a shall weare nothing handsome
about him: in briefe, since I do purpose to marry, I will
thinke nothing to any purpose that the world can say
against it, and therefore neuer flout at me, for I
haue said against it: for man is a giddy thing, and this
is my conclusion: for thy part Claudio, I did thinke to
haue beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my kinsman,
liue vnbruis'd, and loue my cousin.

+CLA
I had well hop'd yu wouldst haue denied
Beatrice, yt I might haue cudgel'd thee out of thy
single life, to make thee a double dealer, which out of
questiõ thou wilt be, if my Cousin do not looke exceeding
narrowly to thee.

+BENE
Come, come, we are friends, let's haue a
dance ere we are married, that we may lighten our own
hearts, and our wiues heeles.

+LEO
Wee'll haue dancing afterward.

+BENE
First, of my word, therfore play musick.
Prince, thou art sad, get thee a wife, get thee a wife,
there is no staff more reuerend then one tipt with
horn.

SD: Enter. +MES

+MESSEN
My Lord, your brother Iohn is tane in flight,
And brought with armed men backe to Messina.

+BENE
Thinke not on him till to morrow, ile deuise
thee braue punishments for him: strike vp Pipers.
SD: Dance.
