NS: Act 1 Scene 1

SD: Enter +BARNARDO and +FRANCISCO two Centinels.
+BARNARDO
WHo's there?
+FRANCISCO
Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold your selfe.
+BARNARDO
Long liue the King.
+FRANCISCO
Barnardo?
+BARNARDO
He.
+FRANCISCO
You come most carefully vpon your houre.
+BARNARDO
'Tis now strook twelue, get thee to bed Francisco.
+FRANCISCO
For this releefe much thankes: 'Tis bitter cold,
And I am sicke at heart.
+BARNARDO
Haue you had quiet Guard?
+FRANCISCO
Not a Mouse stirring.
+BARNARDO
Well, goodnight.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
the Riuals of my Watch, bid them make hast.
SD: Enter +HORATIO and +MARCELLUS.
+FRANCISCO
I thinke I heare them. Stand: who's there?
+HORATIO
Friends to this ground.
+MARCELLUS
And Leige-men to the Dane.
+FRANCISCO
Giue you good night.
+MARCELLUS
O farwel honest Soldier,
who hath relieu'd you?
+FRANCISCO
Barnardo ha's my place:
giue you goodnight.
SD: FRANCISCO exits
+MARCELLUS
Holla Barnardo.
+BARNARDO
Say,
what is Horatio there?
+HORATIO
A peece of him.
+BARNARDO
Welcome Horatio, welcome good Marcellus.
+MARCELLUS
What, ha's this thing appear'd againe to night.
+BARNARDO
I haue seene nothing.
+MARCELLUS
Horatio saies, 'tis but our Fantasie,
And will not let beleefe take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seene of vs,
Therefore I haue intreated him along
With vs, to watch the minutes of this Night,
That if againe this Apparition come,
He may approue our eyes, and speake to it.
+HORATIO
Tush, tush, 'twill not appeare.
+BARNARDO
Sit downe a-while,
And let vs once againe assaile your eares,
That are so fortified against our Story,
What we two Nights haue seene.
+HORATIO
Well, sit we downe,
And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this.
+BARNARDO
Last night of all,
When yond same Starre that's Westward from the Pole
Had made his course t'illume that part of Heauen
Where now it burnes, Marcellus and my selfe,
The Bell then beating one.
SD: Enter the Ghost.
+MARCELLUS
Peace, breake thee of: Looke where it comes againe.
+BARNARDO
In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
+MARCELLUS
Thou art a Scholler; speake to it Horatio.
+BARNARDO
Lookes it not like the King? Marke it Horatio.
+HORATIO
Most like: It harrowes me with fear & wonder
+BARNARDO
It would be spoke too.
+MARCELLUS
Question it Horatio.
+HORATIO
What art thou that vsurp'st this time of night,
Together with that Faire and Warlike forme
In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke
Did sometimes march: By Heauen I charge thee speake.
+MARCELLUS
It is offended.
+BARNARDO
See, it stalkes away.
+HORATIO
Stay: speake; speake: I Charge thee, speake.
SD: The Ghost exits.
+MARCELLUS
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
+BARNARDO
How now Horatio? You tremble & look pale:
Is not this something more then Fantasie?
What thinke you on't?
+HORATIO
Before my God, I might not this beleeue
Without the sensible and true auouch
Of mine owne eyes.
+MARCELLUS
Is it not like the King?
+HORATIO
As thou art to thy selfe,
Such was the very Armour he had on,
When th'Ambitious Norwey combatted:
So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle
He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.
'Tis strange.
+MARCELLUS
Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre,
With Martiall stalke, hath he gone by our Watch.
+HORATIO
In what particular thought to work, I know not:
But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,
This boades some strange erruption to our State.
+MARCELLUS
Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowes
Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch,
So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land,
And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon
And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:
Why such impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore Taske
Do's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke,
What might be toward, that this sweaty hast
Doth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day:
Who is't that can informe me?
+HORATIO
That can I,
At least the whisper goes so: Our last King,
Whose Image euen but now appear'd to vs,
Was [as you know] by Fortinbras of Norway,
[Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride]
Dar'd to the Combate. In which, our Valiant Hamlet,
[For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him]
Did slay this Fortinbras: who by a Seal'd Compact,
Well ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,
Did forfeite [with his life] all those his Lands
Which he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqueror:
Against the which, a Moity competent
Was gaged by our King: which had return'd
To the Inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant
And carriage of the Article designe,
His fell to Hamlet. Now sir, young Fortinbras,
Of vnimproued Mettle, hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,
Shark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes,
For Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize
That hath a stomacke in't: which is no other
[And it doth well appeare vnto our State]
But to recouer of vs by strong hand
And termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands
So by his Father lost: and this [I take it]
Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations,
The Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe head
Of this post-hast, and Romage in the Land.
SD: Enter Ghost againe.
+HORATIO
But soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:
Ile crosse it, though it blast me.
Stay Illusion:
If thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce,
Speake to me.
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease, and grace to me;
speak to me.
If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate
[Which happily foreknowing may auoyd]
Oh speake.
Or, if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life
Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth,
[For which, they say, you Spirits oft walke in death]
Speake of it.
Stay, and speake. Stop it Marcellus.
+MARCELLUS
Shall I strike at it with my Partizan?
+HORATIO
Do, if it will not stand.
+BARNARDO
'Tis heere.
+HORATIO
'Tis heere.
SD: Ghost exits.
+MARCELLUS
'Tis gone.
We do it wrong, being so Maiesticall
To offer it the shew of Violence,
For it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,
And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery.
+BARNARDO
It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew.
+HORATIO
And then it started, like a guilty thing
Vpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard,
The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding Throate
Awake the God of Day: and at his warning,
Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,
Th'extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyes
To his Confine. And of the truth heerein,
This present Obiect made probation.
+MARCELLUS
It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.
Some sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes
Wherein our Sauiours Birth is celebrated,
The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:
And then [they say] no Spirit can walke abroad,
The nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,
No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:
So hallow'd, and so gracious is the time.
+HORATIO
So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.
But looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad,
Walkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,
Breake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice
Let vs impart what we haue seene to night
Vnto yong Hamlet. For vpon my life,
This Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him:
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?
+MARCELLUS
Let do't I pray, and I this morning know
Where we shall finde him most conueniently.
SD: Exuent +BARNARDO, +FRANCISCO, +HORATIO, +MARCELLUS

NS: Act 1, scene 2

SD: Enter +CLAUDIUS King of Denmarke, +GERTRUDE the Queene, +HAMLET, +POLONIUS, +LAERTES, and his Sister +OPHELIA, Lords Attendant.
+CLAUDIUS
Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death
The memory be greene: and that it vs befitted
To beare our hearts in greefe, and our whole Kingdome
To be contracted in one brow of woe:
Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature,
That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,
Together with remembrance of our selues.
Therefore our sometimes Sister, now our Queen,
Th'Imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State,
Haue we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy,
With one Auspicious, and one Dropping eye,
With mirth in Funerall, and with Dirge in Marriage,
In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole
Taken to Wife; nor haue we heerein barr'd
Your better Wisedomes, which haue freely gone
With this affaire along, for all our Thankes.
Now followes, that you know young Fortinbras,
Holding a weake supposall of our worth;
Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death,
Our State to be disioynt, and out of Frame,
Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage;
He hath not fayl'd to pester vs with Message,
Importing the surrender of those Lands
Lost by his Father: with all Bonds of Law
To our most valiant Brother. So much for him.
SD: Enter +VOLTEMAND and +CORNELIUS.
+CLAUDIUS
Now for our selfe, and for this time of meeting
Thus much the businesse is. We haue heere writ
To Norway, Vncle of young Fortinbras,
Who Impotent and Bedrid, scarsely heares
Of this his Nephewes purpose, to suppresse
His further gate heerein. In that the Leuies,
The Lists, and full proportions are all made
Out of his subiect: and we heere dispatch
You good Cornelius, and you Voltemand,
For bearing of this greeting to old Norway,
Giuing to you no further personall power
To businesse with the King, more then the scope
Of these dilated Articles allow:
Farewell, and let your hast commend your duty.
+VOLTEMAND
In that, and all things, will we shew our duty.
+CLAUDIUS
We doubt it nothing, heartily farewell.
SD: +VOLTEMAND and +CORNELIUS exits.
+CLAUDIUS
And now Laertes, what's the newes with you?
You told vs of some suite. What is't Laertes?
You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane,
And loose your voyce. What would'st thou beg Laertes,
That shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking?
The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart,
The Hand more Instrumentall to the Mouth,
Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father.
What would'st thou haue Laertes?
+LAERTES
Dread my Lord,
Your leaue and fauour to returne to France,
From whence, though willingly I came to Denmarke
To shew my duty in your Coronation,
Yet now I must confesse, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France,
And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon.
+CLAUDIUS
Haue you your Fathers leaue? / What sayes Pollonius?
+POLONIUS
He hath my Lord:
I do beseech you giue him leaue to go.
+CLAUDIUS
Take thy faire houre Laertes, time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will:
But now my Cosin Hamlet, and my Sonne?
+HAMLET
A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde.
+CLAUDIUS
How is it that the Clouds still hang on you?
+HAMLET
Not so my Lord, I am too much i'th' Sun.
+GERTRUDE
Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off,
And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.
Do not for euer with thy veyled lids
Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust;
Thou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye,
Passing through Nature, to Eternity.
+HAMLET
I Madam, it is common.
+GERTRUDE
If it be;
Why seemes it so particular with thee.
+HAMLET
Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:
'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)
Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke,
Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
No, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,
Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,
Together with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,
That can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme,
For they are actions that a man might play:
But I haue that Within, which passeth show;
These, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe.
+CLAUDIUS
'Tis sweet and commendable / In your Nature Hamlet,
To giue these mourning duties to your Father:
But you must know, your Father lost a Father,
That Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer bound
In filiall Obligation, for some terme
To do obsequious Sorrow. But to perseuer
In obstinate Condolement, is a course
Of impious stubbornnesse. 'Tis vnmanly greefe,
It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen,
A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,
An Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:
For, what we know must be, and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sence,
Why should we in our peeuish Opposition
Take it to heart? Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen,
A fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,
To Reason most absurd, whose common Theame
Is death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,
This must be so. We pray you throw to earth
This vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs
As of a Father; For let the world take note,
You are the most immediate to our Throne,
And with no lesse Nobility of Loue,
Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,
Do I impart towards you. For your intent
In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And we beseech you, bend you to remaine
Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye,
Our cheefest Courtier Cosin, and our Sonne.
+GERTRUDE
Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet:
I prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg.
+HAMLET
I shall in all my best / Obey you Madam.
+CLAUDIUS
Why 'tis a louing, and a faire Reply,
Be as our selfe in Denmarke. Madam come,
This gentle and vnforc'd accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day,
But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell,
And the Kings Rouce, the Heauens shall bruite againe,
Respeaking earthly Thunder. Come away.
SD: Exeunt +CLAUDIUS, +GERTRUDE, +POLONIUS, +LAERTES, +OPHELIA
SD: Manet +HAMLET.
+HAMLET
Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt,
Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:
Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt
His Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter. O God, O God!
How weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable
Seemes to me all the vses of this world?
Fie on't? Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded Garden
That growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Nature
Possesse it meerely. That it should come to this:
But two months dead: Nay, not so much; not two,
So excellent a King, that was to this
Hiperion to a Satyre: so louing to my Mother,
That he might not beteene the windes of heauen
Visit her face too roughly. Heauen and Earth
Must I remember: why she would hang on him,
As if encrease of Appetite had growne
By what it fed on; and yet within a month?
Let me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman.
A little Month, or ere those shooes were old,
With which she followed my poore Fathers body
Like Niobe, all teares. Why she, euen she.
(O Heauen! A beast that wants discourse of Reason
Would haue mourn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle,
My Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father,
Then I to Hercules. Within a Moneth?
Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares
Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes,
She married. O most wicked speed, to post
With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets:
It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
But breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
SD: Enter +HORATIO, +BARNARDO, and +MARCELLUS.
+HORATIO
Haile to your Lordship.
+HAMLET
I am glad to see you well:
Horatio, or I do forget my selfe.
+HORATIO
The same my Lord, / And your poore Seruant euer.
+HAMLET
Sir my good friend, / Ile change that name with you:
And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio?
+MARCELLUS
My good Lord.
+HAMLET
I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir.
But what in faith make you from Wittemberge?
+HORATIO
A truant disposition, good my Lord.
+HAMLET
I would not haue your Enemy say so;
Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence,
To make it truster of your owne report
Against your selfe. I know you are no Truant:
But what is your affaire in Elsenour?
Wee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart.
+HORATIO
My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall.
+HAMLET
I pray thee doe not mock me [fellow Student]
I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding.
+HORATIO
Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon.
+HAMLET
Thrift, thrift Horatio: the Funerall Bakt-meats
Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables;
Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen,
Ere I had euer seene that day Horatio.
My father, me thinkes I see my father.
+HORATIO
Oh where my Lord?
+HAMLET
In my minds eye [Horatio]
+HORATIO
I saw him once; he was a goodly King.
+HAMLET
He was a man, take him for all in all:
I shall not look vpon his like againe.
+HORATIO
My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight.
+HAMLET
Saw? Who?
+HORATIO
My Lord, the King your Father.
+HAMLET
The King my Father?
+HORATIO
Season your admiration for a while
With an attent eare; till I may deliuer
Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,
This maruell to you.
+HAMLET
For Heauens loue let me heare.
+HORATIO
Two nights together, had these Gentlemen
[Marcellus and Barnardo] on their Watch
In the dead wast and middle of the night
Beene thus encountred. A figure like your Father,
Arm'd at all points exactly, Cap a Pe,
Appeares before them, and with sollemne march
Goes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,
By their opprest and feare-surprized eyes,
Within his Truncheons length; whilst they bestil'd
Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare,
Stand dumbe and speake not to him. This to me
In dreadfull secrecie impart they did,
And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,
Whereas they had deliuer'd both in time,
Forme of the thing; each word made true and good,
The Apparition comes. I knew your Father:
These hands are not more like.
+HAMLET
But where was this?
+MARCELLUS
My Lord, vpon the platforme where we watcht.
+HAMLET
Did you not speake to it?
+HORATIO
My Lord, I did;
But answere made it none: yet once me thought
It lifted vp it head, and did addresse
It selfe to motion, like as it would speake:
But euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;
And at the sound it shrunke in hast away,
And vanisht from our sight.
+HAMLET
Tis very strange.
+HORATIO
As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;
And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty
To let you know of it.
+HAMLET
Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to Night?
+BARNARDO, +MARCELLUS
We doe my Lord.
+HAMLET
Arm'd, say you?
+BARNARDO, +MARCELLUS
Arm'd, my Lord.
+HAMLET
From top to toe?
+BARNARDO, +MARCELLUS
My Lord, from head to foote.
+HAMLET
Then saw you not his face?
+HORATIO
O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp.
+HAMLET
What, lookt he frowningly?
+HORATIO
A countenance more in sorrow then in anger.
+HAMLET
Pale, or red?
+HORATIO
Nay very pale.
+HAMLET
And fixt his eyes vpon you?
+HORATIO
Most constantly.
+HAMLET
I would I had beene there.
+HORATIO
It would haue much amaz'd you.
+HAMLET
Very like, very like: staid it long?
+HORATIO
While one with moderate hast might tell a hun-(dred.
+BARNARDO, +HORATIO, +MARCELLUS
Longer, longer.
+HORATIO
Not when I saw't.
+HAMLET
His Beard was grisly? no.
+HORATIO
It was, as I haue seene it in his life,
A Sable Siluer'd.
+HAMLET
Ile watch to Night;
perchance 'twill wake a-(gaine.
+HORATIO
I warrant you it will.
+HAMLET
If it assume my noble Fathers person,
Ile speake to it, though Hell it selfe should gape
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
If you haue hitherto conceald this sight;
Let it bee treble in your silence still:
And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,
Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue;
I will requite your loues; so, fare ye well:
Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue,
Ile visit you.
+BARNARDO, +HORATIO, +MARCELLUS
Our duty to your Honour.
+HAMLET
Your loue, as mine to you: farewell.
SD: Exeunt +BARNARDO, +HORATIO, +MARCELLUS
+HAMLET
My Fathers Spirit in Armes? All is not well:
I doubt some foule play: would the Night were come;
Till then sit still my soule; foule deeds will rise,
Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies.
SD: HAMLET exits




NS: Act 1 Scene 3

SD: Enter +LAERTES and +OPHELIA.
+LAERTES
My necessaries are imbark't; Farewell:
And Sister, as the Winds giue Benefit,
And Conuoy is assistant; doe not sleepe,
But let me heare from you.

+OPHELIA
Doe you doubt that?

+LAERTES
For Hamlet, and the trifling of his fauours,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloud;
A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature;
Froward, not permanent; sweet not lasting
The suppliance of a minute? No more.

+OPHELIA
No more but so.

+LAERTES
Thinke it no more:
For nature cressant does not grow alone,
In thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,
The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule
Growes wide withall. Perhaps he loues you now,
And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch
The vertue of his feare: but you must feare
His greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne;
For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth:
Hee may not, as vnuallued persons doe,
Carue for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends
The sanctity and health of the weole State.
And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd
Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body,
Whereof he is the Head. Then if he sayes he loues you,
It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;
As he in his peculiar Sect and force
May giue his saying deed: which is no further,
Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall.
Then weigh what losse your Honour may sustaine,
If with too credent eare you list his Songs;
Or lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure open
To his vnmastred importunity.
Feare it Ophelia, feare it my deare Sister,
And keepe within the reare of your Affection;
Out of the shot and danger of Desire.
The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,
If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone:
Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes,
The Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring
Too oft before the buttons be disclos'd,
And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then, best safety lies in feare;
Youth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere.

+OPHELIA
I shall th'effect of this good Lesson keepe,
As watchmen to my heart: but good my Brother
Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe,
Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen;
Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine
Himselfe, the Primrose path of dalliance treads,
And reaks not his owne reade.

+LAERTES
Oh, feare me not.
I stay too long;

SD: Enter +POLONIUS. but here my FATHER comes:
A double blessing is a double grace;
Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue.

+POLONIUS
Yet heere Laertes? Aboord, aboord for shame,
The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile,
And you are staid for there: my blessing with you;
And these few Precepts in thy memory,
See thou Character. Giue thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any vnproportion'd thought his Act:
Be thou familiar; but by no meanes vulgar:
The friends thou hast, and their adoption tride,
Grapple them to thy Soule, with hoopes of Steele:
But doe not dull thy palme, with entertainment
Of each vnhatch't, vnfledg'd Comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrell: but being in
Bear't that th'opposed may beware of thee.
Giue euery man thine eare; but few thy voyce:
Take each mans censure; but reserue thy iudgement:
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy;
But not exprest in fancie; rich, not gawdie:
For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man.
And they in France of the best ranck and station,
Are of a most select and generous cheff in that.
Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;
For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend:
And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry.
This aboue all; to thine owne selfe be true:
And it must follow, as the Night the Day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell: my Blessing season this in thee.

+LAERTES
Most humbly doe I take my leaue, my Lord.

+POLONIUS
The time inuites you, goe, your seruants tend.

+LAERTES
Farewell Ophelia, and remember well
What I haue said to you.

+OPHELIA
Tis in my memory lockt,
And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it.

+LAERTES
Farewell.
SD: LAERTES exits

+POLONIUS
What ist Ophelia he hath said to you?

+OPHELIA
So please you, somthing touching the L. Hamlet.

+POLONIUS
Marry, well bethought:
Tis told me he hath very oft of late
Giuen priuate time to you; and you your selfe
Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous.
If it be so, as so tis put on me;
And that in way of caution: I must tell you,
You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely,
As it behoues my Daughter, and your Honour.
What is betweene you, giue me vp the truth?

+OPHELIA
He hath my Lord of late, made many tenders
Of his affection to me.

+POLONIUS
Affection, puh. You speake like a greene Girle,
Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance.
Doe you beleeue his tenders, as you call them?

+OPHELIA
I do not know, my Lord, what I should thinke.

+POLONIUS
Marry Ile teach you; thinke your selfe a Baby,
That you haue tane his tenders for true pay,
Which are not starling. Tender your selfe more dearly;
Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase,
Roaming it thus, you'l tender me a foole.

+OPHELIA
My Lord, he hath importun'd me with loue,
In honourable fashion.

+POLONIUS
I, fashion you may call it, go too, go too.

+OPHELIA
And hath giuen countenance to his speech, / My Lord,
with all the vowes of Heauen.

+POLONIUS
I, Springes to catch Woodcocks. I doe know
When the Bloud burnes, how Prodigall the Soule
Giues the tongue vowes: these blazes, Daughter,
Giuing more light then heate; extinct in both,
Euen in their promise, as it is a making;
You must not take for fire. For this time Daughter,
Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence;
Set your entreatments at a higher rate,
Then a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Beleeue so much in him, that he is young,
And with a larger tether may he walke,
Then may be giuen you. In few, Ophelia,
Doe not beleeue his vowes; for they are Broakers,
Not of the eye, which their Inuestments show:
But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
I would not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth,
Haue you so slander any moment leisure,
As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet:
Looke too't, I charge you; come your wayes.

+OPHELIA
I shall obey my Lord.

NS: Act 1 Scene 4

SD: Enter +HAMLET, +HORATIO, +MARCELLUS.
+HAMLET
The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold?

+HORATIO
It is a nipping and an eager ayre.

+HAMLET
What hower now?

+HORATIO
I thinke it lacks of twelue.

+MARCELLUS
No, it is strooke.

+HORATIO
Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the season,
Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke.

+HAMLET
What does this meane my Lord?

+HAMLET
The King doth wake to night, and takes his rouse,
Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles,
And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe,
The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his Pledge.

+HORATIO
Is it a custome?

+HAMLET
I marry ist;
And to my mind, though I am natiue heere,
And to the manner borne: It is a Custome
More honour'd in the breach, then the obseruance.

SD: Enter Ghost.
+HORATIO
Looke my Lord, it comes.

+HAMLET
Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs:
Be thou a Spirit of health, or Goblin damn'd,
Bring with thee ayres from Heauen, or blasts from Hell,
Be thy euents wicked or charitable,
Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
That I will speake to thee. Ile call thee Hamlet,
King, Father, Royall Dane: Oh, oh, answer me,
Let me not burst in Ignorance; but tell
Why thy Canoniz'd bones Hearsed in death,
Haue burst their cerments, why the Sepulcher
Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn'd,
Hath op'd his ponderous and Marble iawes,
To cast thee vp againe? What may this meane?
That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele,
Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone,
Making Night hidious? And we fooles of Nature,
So horridly to shake our disposition,
With thoughts beyond thee; reaches of our Soules,
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we doe?

SD: Ghost beckens HAMLET.
+HORATIO
It beckons you to goe away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone.

+MARCELLUS
Looke with what courteous action
It wafts you to a more remoued ground:
But doe not goe with it.

+HORATIO
No, by no meanes.

+HAMLET
It will not speake: then will I follow it.

+HORATIO
Doe not my Lord.

+HAMLET
Why, what should be the feare?
I doe not set my life at a pins fee;
And for my Soule, what can it doe to that?
Being a thing immortall as it selfe:
It waues me forth againe; Ile follow it.

+HORATIO
What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord?
Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe,
That beetles o're his base into the Sea,
And there assumes some other horrible forme,
Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason,
And draw you into madnesse thinke of it?

+HAMLET
It wafts me still:
goe on, Ile follow thee.

+MARCELLUS
You shall not goe my Lord.

+HAMLET
Hold off your hand.

+HORATIO
Be rul'd, you shall not goe.

+HAMLET
My fate cries out,
And makes each petty Artire in this body,
As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue:
Still am I cal'd? Vnhand me Gentlemen:
By Heau'n, Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me:
I say away, goe on, Ile follow thee.
SD: Exeunt Ghost, +HAMLET

+HORATIO
He waxes desperate with imagination.

+MARCELLUS
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.

+HORATIO
Haue after, to what issue will this come?

+MARCELLUS
Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke.

+HORATIO
Heauen will direct it.

+MARCELLUS
Nay, let's follow him.

NS: Act 1 Scene 5

SD: Enter Ghost and +HAMLET.
+HAMLET
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; Ile go no further.

+GHOST
Marke me.

+HAMLET
I will.

+GHOST
My hower is almost come,
When I to sulphurous and tormenting Flames
Must render vp my selfe.

+HAMLET
Alas poore Ghost.

+GHOST
Pitty me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall vnfold.

+HAMLET
Speake, I am bound to heare.

+GHOST
So art thou to reuenge, when thou shalt heare.

+HAMLET
What?

+GHOST
I am thy Fathers Spirit,
Doom'd for a certaine terme to walke the night;
And for the day confin'd to fast in Fiers,
Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature
Are burnt and purg'd away? But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my Prison-House;
I could a Tale vnfold, whose lightest word
Would harrow vp thy soule, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes like Starres, start from their Spheres,
Thy knotty and combined locks to part,
And each particular haire to stand an end,
Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine:
But this eternall blason must not be
To eares of flesh and bloud; list Hamlet, oh list,
If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue.

+HAMLET
Oh Heauen!

+GHOST
Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther.

+HAMLET
Murther?

+GHOST
Murther most foule, as in the best it is;
But this most foule, strange, and vnnaturall.

+HAMLET
Hast, hast me to know it, / That with wings as swift
As meditation, or the thoughts of Loue,
May sweepe to my Reuenge.

+GHOST
I finde thee apt,
And duller should'st thou be then the fat weede
That rots it selfe in ease, on Lethe Wharfe,
Would'st thou not stirre in this. Now Hamlet heare:
It's giuen out, that sleeping in mine Orchard,
A Serpent stung me: so the whole eare of Denmarke,
Is by a forged processe of my death
Rankly abus'd: But know thou Noble youth,
The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life,
Now weares his Crowne.

+HAMLET
O my Propheticke soule:
mine Vncle?

+GHOST
I that incestuous, that adulterate Beast
With witchcraft of his wits, hath Traitorous guifts.
Oh wicked Wit, and Gifts, that haue the power
So to seduce? Won to to this shamefull Lust
The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene:
Oh Hamlet, what a falling off was there,
From me, whose loue was of that dignity,
That it went hand in hand, euen with the Vow
I made to her in Marriage; and to decline
Vpon a wretch, whose Naturall gifts were poore
To those of mine.
But Vertue, as it neuer wil be moued,
Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen:
So Lust, though to a radiant Angell link'd,
Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed,
& prey on Garbage.
But soft, me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre;
Briefe let me be: Sleeping within mine Orchard,
My custome alwayes in the afternoone;
Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole
With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl,
And in the Porches of mine eares did poure
The leaperous Distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man,
That swift as Quick-siluer, it courses through
The naturall Gates and Allies of the Body;
And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset
And curd, like Aygre droppings into Milke,
The thin and wholsome blood: so did it mine;
And a most instant Tetter bak'd about,
Most Lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
All my smooth Body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a Brothers hand,
Of Life, of Crowne, and Queene at once dispatcht;
Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne,
Vnhouzzled, disappointed, vnnaneld,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head;
Oh horrible, Oh horrible, most horrible:
If thou hast nature in thee beare it not;
Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be
A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest.
But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act,
Taint not thy mind; nor let thy Soule contriue
Against thy Mother ought; leaue her to heauen,
And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge,
To pricke and sting her. Fare thee well at once;
The Glow-worme showes the Matine to be neere,
And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire:
Adue, adue, Hamlet: remember me.
SD: Ghost exits

+HAMLET
Oh all you host of Heauen! Oh Earth; what els?
And shall I couple Hell? Oh fie: hold my heart;
And you my sinnewes, grow not instant Old;
But beare me stiffely vp: Remember thee?
I, thou poore Ghost, while memory holds a seate
In this distracted Globe: Remember thee?
Yea, from the Table of my Memory,
Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records,
All sawes of Bookes, all formes, all presures past,
That youth and obseruation coppied there;
And thy Commandment all alone shall liue
Within the Booke and Volume of my Braine,
Vnmixt with baser matter; yes, yes, by Heauen:
Oh most pernicious woman!
Oh Villaine, Villaine, smiling damned Villaine!
My Tables, my Tables; meet it is I set it downe,
That one may smile, and smile and be a Villaine;
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmarke;
So Vnckle there you are: now to my word;
It is; Adue, Adue, Remember me:
I haue sworn't.

Oh wonderfull!

Good my Lord tell it.

No you'l reueale it.

Not I, my Lord, by Heauen.

How say you then, would heart of man once think it?
But you'l be secret?

SD: +HORATIO, +MARCELLUS

+HAMLET
There's nere a villaine dwelling in all Denmarke
But hee's an arrant knaue.

+HORATIO
There needs no Ghost my Lord, come from the / Graue,
to tell vs this.

+HAMLET
Why right, you are i'th' right;
And so, without more circumstance at all,
I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part:
You, as your busines and desires shall point you:
For euery man ha's businesse and desire,
Such as it is: and for mine owne poore part,
Looke you, Ile goe pray.

+HORATIO
These are but wild and hurling words, my Lord.

+HAMLET
I'm sorry they offend you heartily:
Yes faith, heartily.

+HORATIO
There's no offence my Lord.

+HAMLET
Yes, by Saint Patricke, but there is my Lord,
And much offence too, touching this Vision heere:
It is an honest Ghost, that let me tell you:
For your desire to know what is betweene vs,
O'remaster't as you may. And now good friends,
As you are Friends, Schollers and Soldiers,
Giue me one poore request.

+HORATIO
What is't my Lord? we will.

+HAMLET
Neuer make known what you haue seen to night.

SD: +HORATIO, +MARCELLUS
My Lord, we will not.

Nay, but swear't.

Indeed, vpon my sword, Indeed.

SD: Ghost cries vnder the Stage.

Ah ha boy, sayest thou so. Art thou there truepenny?
Come one you here this fellow in the selleredge
Consent to sweare.

+HORATIO
Propose the Oath my Lord.

Neuer to speake of this that you haue seene.
Sweare by my sword.

+GHOST
Sweare.

+HAMLET
Hic & vbique? Then wee'l shift for grownd,
Come hither Gentlemen,
And lay your hands againe vpon my sword,
Sweare by my Sword.
Neuer to speake of this that you haue heard:

+GHOST
Sweare.

+HAMLET
Well said old Mole, can'st worke i'th' ground so fast?
A worthy Pioner, once more remoue good friends.

+HORATIO
Oh day and night: but this is wondrous strange.

+HAMLET
And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome.
There are more things in Heauen and Earth, Horatio,
Then are dream't of in our Philosophy.
But come,
Here as before, neuer so helpe you mercy,
How strange or odde so ere I beare my selfe;
[As I perchance heereafter shall thinke meet
To put an Anticke disposition on:]
That you at such time seeing me, neuer shall
With Armes encombred thus, or thus, head shake;
Or by pronouncing of some doubtfull Phrase;
As well, we know, or we could and if we would,
Or if we list to speake; or there be and if there might,
Or such ambiguous giuing out to note,
That you know ought of me; this not to doe:
So grace and mercy at your most neede helpe you: / Sweare.

+GHOST
Sweare.

+HAMLET
Rest, rest perturbed Spirit: so Gentlemen,
With all my loue I doe commend me to you;
And what so poore a man as Hamlet is,
May doe t' expresse his loue and friending to you,
God willing shall not lacke: let vs goe in together,
And still your fingers on your lippes I pray,
The time is out of ioynt: Oh cursed spight,
That euer I was borne to set it right.
Nay, come let's goe together.

+POLONIUS
Giue him his money, and these notes Reynoldo.

+REYNALDO
I will my Lord.

+POLONIUS
You shall doe maruels wisely: good Reynoldo,
Before you visite him you make inquiry
Of his behauiour.

+REYNALDO
My Lord, I did intend it.

+POLONIUS
Marry, well said; / Very well said. Looke you Sir,
Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
And how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe:
What company, at what expence: and finding
By this encompassement and drift of question,
That they doe know my sonne: Come you more neerer
Then your particular demands will touch it,
Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,
And thus I know his father and his friends,
And in part him. Doe you marke this Reynoldo?

+REYNALDO
I, very well my Lord.

+POLONIUS
And in part him, but you may say not well;
But if't be hee I meane, hees very wilde;
Addicted so and so; and there put on him
What forgeries you please: marry, none so ranke,
As may dishonour him; take heed of that:
But Sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips,
As are Companions noted and most knowne
To youth and liberty.

+REYNALDO
As gaming my Lord.

+POLONIUS
I, or drinking, fencing, swearing, / Quarelling,
drabbiug. You may goe so farre.

+REYNALDO
My Lord that would dishonour him.

+POLONIUS
Faith no, as you may season it in the charge;
You must not put another scandall on him,
That hee is open to Incontinencie;
That's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly,
That they may seeme the taints of liberty;
The flash and out-breake of a fiery minde,
A sauagenes in vnreclaim'd bloud
of generall assault.

+REYNALDO
But my good Lord.

+POLONIUS
Wherefore should you doe this?

+REYNALDO
I my Lord,
I would know that.

+POLONIUS
Marry Sir, heere's my drift,
And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant:
You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne,
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i'th' working:
Marke you
your party in conuerse; him you would sound,
Hauing euer seene. In the prenominate crimes,
The youth you breath of guilty, be assur'd
He closes with you in this consequence:
Good sir, or so, or friend, or Gentleman.
According to the Phrase and the Addition,
Of man and Country.

+REYNALDO
Very good my Lord.

+POLONIUS
And then Sir does he this? / He does: what
was I about to say? I was about to say
somthing: where did I leaue?

+REYNALDO
At closes in the consequence: / At friend,
or so, and Gentleman.

+POLONIUS
At closes in the consequence, I marry,
He closes with you thus. I know the Gentleman,
I saw him yesterday, or tother day;
Or then or then, with such and such; and as you say,
There was he gaming, there o'retooke in's Rouse,
There falling out at Tennis; or perchance,
I saw him enter such a house of saile;
Videlicet, a Brothell, or so forth.
See you now;
Your bait of falshood, takes this Cape of truth;
And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach
With windlesses, and with assaies of Bias,
By indirections finde directions out:
So by my former Lecture and aduice
Shall you my Sonne; you haue me, haue you not?

+REYNALDO
My Lord I haue.

+POLONIUS
God buy you; fare you well.

+REYNALDO
Good my Lord.

+POLONIUS
Obserue his inclination in your selfe.

+REYNALDO
I shall my Lord.

+POLONIUS
And let him plye his Musicke.

+REYNALDO
Well, my Lord.

Farewell:

Enter +OPHELIA.
How now Ophelia, what's the matter?

+OPHELIA
Alas my Lord, I haue beene so affrighted.

+POLONIUS
With what, in the name of Heauen?

+OPHELIA
My Lord, as I was sowing in my Chamber,
Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac'd,
No hat vpon his head, his stockings foul'd,
Vngartred, and downe giued to his Anckle,
Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
And with a looke so pitious in purport,
As if he had been loosed out of hell,
To speake of horrors: he comes before me.

+POLONIUS
Mad for thy Loue?

+OPHELIA
My Lord, I doe not know:
but truly I do feare it.

+POLONIUS
What said he?

+OPHELIA
He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arme;
And with his other hand thus o're his brow,
He fals to such perusall of my face,
As he would draw it. Long staid he so,
At last, a little shaking of mine Arme:
And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;
He rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound,
That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke,
And end his being. That done, he lets me goe,
And with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd,
He seem'd to finde his way without his eyes,
For out adores he went without their helpe;
And to the last, bended their light on me.

+POLONIUS
Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King,
This is the very extasie of Loue,
Whose violent property foredoes it selfe,
And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,
As oft as any passion vnder Heauen,
That does afflict our Natures. I am sorrie,
What haue you giuen him any hard words of late?

+OPHELIA
No my good Lord: but as you did command,
I did repell his Letters, and deny'de
His accesse to me.

+POLONIUS
That hath made him mad.
I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement
I had not quoted him. I feare he did but trifle,
And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:
It seemes it is as proper to our Age,
To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions,
As it is common for the yonger sort
To lacke discretion. Come, go we to the King,
This must be knowne, wc being kept close might moue
More greefe to hide, then hate to vtter loue.

+KING
Welcome deere Rosincrance and Guildensterne.
Moreouer, that we much did long to see you,
The neede we haue to vse you, did prouoke
Our hastie sending.
Something haue you heard
Of Hamlets transformation: so I call it,
Since not th'exterior, nor the inward man
Resembles that it was.
What it should bee
More then his Fathers death, that thus hath put him
So much from th'vnderstanding of himselfe,
I cannot deeme of.
I intreat you both,
That being of so young dayes brought vp with him:
And since so Neighbour'd to his youth, and humour,
That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court
Some little time: so by your Companies
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
So much as from Occasions you may gleane,
That open'd lies within our remedie.

+QUEENE
Good Gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
And sure I am, two men there are not liuing,
To whom he more adheres.
If it will please you
To shew vs so much Gentrie, and good will,
As to expend your time with vs a-while,
For the supply and profit of our Hope,
Your Visitation shall receiue such thankes
As fits a Kings remembrance.

+ROSANCRANCE
Both your Maiesties
Might by the Soueraigne power you haue of vs,
Put your dread pleasures, more into Command
Then to Entreatie.

+GUILDENSTERN
We both obey,
And here giue vp our selues, in the full bent,
To lay our Seruices freely at your feete,
To be commanded.

+KING
Thankes Rosincrance, and gentle Guildensterne.

+QUEENE
Thankes Guildensterne and gentle Rosincrance.
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed Sonne. / Go some of ye,
And bring the Gentlemen where Hamlet is.

Heauens make our presence and our practises
Pleasant and helpfull to him.

Haue I, my Lord?
Assure you, my good Liege,
I hold my dutie, as I hold my Soule,
Both to my God, one to my gracious King:
And I do thinke, or else this braine of mine
Hunts not the traile of Policie, so sure
As I haue vs'd to do: that I haue found
The very cause of Hamlets Lunacie.

+KING
Oh speake of that, that I do long to heare.

+POLONIUS
Giue first admittance to th'Ambassadors,
My Newes shall be the Newes to that great Feast.

+KING
Thy selfe do grace to them, and bring them in.
He tels me my sweet Queene, that he hath found
The head and sourse of all your Sonnes distemper.

+QUEENE
I doubt it is no other, but the maine,
His Fathers death, and our o're-hasty Marriage.

Well, we shall sift him.

SD: Enter +POLONIUS, +VOLTUMAND, and +CORNELIUS.

+KING
Welcome good Frends:
Say Voltumand, what from our Brother Norwey?

+VOLTUMAND
Most faire returne of Greetings, and Desires.
Vpon our first, he sent out to suppresse
His Nephewes Leuies, which to him appear'd
To be a preparation 'gainst the Poleak:
But better look'd into, he truly found
It was against your Highnesse, whereat greeued,
That so his Sicknesse, Age, and Impotence
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out Arrests
On Fortinbras, which he [in breefe] obeyes,
Receiues rebuke from Norwey: and in fine,
Makes Vow before his Vnkle, neuer more
To giue th'assay of Armes against your Maiestie.
Whereon old Norwey, ouercome with ioy,
Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee,
And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers
So leuied as before, against the Poleak:
With an intreaty heerein further shewne,
That it might please you to giue quiet passe
Through your Dominions, for his Enterprize,
On such regards of safety and allowance,
As therein are set downe.

+KING
It likes vs well:
And at our more consider'd time wee'l read,
Answer, and thinke vpon this Businesse.
Meane time we thanke you, for your well-tooke Labour.
Go to your rest, at night wee'l Feast together.
Most welcome home.

SD: Exit Ambass.

+POLONIUS
This businesse is very well ended.
My Liege, and Madam, to expostulate
What Maiestie should be, what Dutie is,
Why day is day; night, night; and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste Night, Day, and Time.
Therefore, since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit,
And tediousnesse, the limbes and outward flourishes,
I will be breefe.
Your Noble Sonne is mad:
Mad call I it; for to define true Madnesse,
What is't, but to be nothing else but mad.
But let that go.

+QUEENE
More matter, with lesse Art.

+POLONIUS
Madam, I sweare I vse no Art at all:
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'Tis true 'tis pittie,
And pittie it is true: A foolish figure,
But farewell it: for I will vse no Art.
Mad let vs grant him then: and now remaines
That we finde out the cause of this effect,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect;
For this effect defectiue, comes by cause,
Thus it remaines, and the remainder thus.
Perpend,
I haue a daughter: haue, whil'st she is mine,
Who in her Dutie and Obedience, marke,
Hath giuen me this: now gather, and surmise.
The Letter.
To the Celestiall, and my Soules Idoll, the most beautifed
Ophelia. / That's an ill Phrase, a vilde Phrase, beautified
is a vilde Phrase: but you shall heare these
in her excellent white bosome, these.

+QUEENE
Came this from Hamlet to her.

+POLONIUS
Good Madam stay awhile, I will be faithfull.
Doubt thou, the Starres are fire,
Doubt, that the Sunne doth moue:
Doubt Truth to be a Lier,
But neuer Doubt, I loue.
O deere Ophelia, I am ill at these Numbers: I haue not Art
toreckon my grones; but that I loue thee best, oh most Best
beleeue it.
Adieu.
Thine euermore most deere Lady, whilst
this Machine is to him,
Hamlet.
This in Obedience hath my daughter shew'd me:
And more aboue hath his soliciting,
As they fell out by Time, by Meanes, and Place,
All giuen to mine eare.

+KING
But how hath she
receiu'd his Loue?

+POLONIUS
What do you thinke of me?

+KING
As of a man, faithfull and Honourable.

+POLONIUS
I wold faine proue so.
But what might you think?
When I had seene this hot loue on the wing,
As I perceiued it, I must tell you that
Before my Daughter told me what might you
Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere, think,
If I had playd the Deske or Table-booke,
Or giuen my heart a winking, mute and dumbe,
Or look'd vpon this Loue, with idle sight,
What might you thinke?
No, I went round to worke,
And [my yong Mistris] thus I did bespeake
Lord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre,
This must not be: and then, I Precepts gaue her,
That she should locke her selfe from his Resort,
Admit no Messengers, receiue no Tokens:
Which done, she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice,
And he repulsed.
A short Tale to make,
Fell into a Sadnesse, then into a Fast,
Thence to a Watch, thence into a Weaknesse,
Thence to a Lightnesse, and by this declension
Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues,
And all we waile for.

+KING
Do you thinke 'tis this?

+QUEENE
It may be very likely.

+POLONIUS
Hath there bene such a time, I'de fain know that,
That I haue possitiuely said, 'tis so,
When it prou'd otherwise?

+KING
Not that I know.

+POLONIUS
Take this from this; if this be otherwise,
If Circumstances leade me, I will finde
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeede
Within the Center.

+KING
How may we try it further?

+POLONIUS
You know sometimes / +He walkes foure houres together,
heere / In the Lobby.

+QUEENE
So +he ha's indeed.

+POLONIUS
At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him,
Be you and I behinde an Arras then,
Marke the encounter: If he loue her not,
And be not from his reason falne thereon;
Let me be no Assistant for a State,
And keepe a Farme and Carters.

+KING
We will try it.
SD: Enter +HAMLET reading on a Booke.

+QUEENE
But looke where sadly the poore wretch / Comes reading.

+POLONIUS
Away I do beseech you, both away,
Ile boord him presently. / Oh giue me leaue.

SD: +KING and +QUEEN Exit

+POLONIUS
How does my good Lord Hamlet?

+HAMLET
Well, God-a-mercy.

+POLONIUS
Do you know me, my Lord?

+HAMLET
Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger.

+POLONIUS
Not I my Lord.

+HAMLET
Then I would you were so honest a man.

+POLONIUS
Honest, my Lord?

+HAMLET
I sir, to be honest as this world goes, is to bee
one man pick'd out of two thousand.

+POLONIUS
That's very true, my Lord.

+HAMLET
For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge,
being a good kissing Carrion----- / Haue you a daughter?

+POLONIUS
I haue my Lord.

+HAMLET
Let her not walke i'th'Sunne: Conception is a blessing,
but not as your daughter may conceiue.
Friend looke
too't.

+POLONIUS
How say you by that?
Still harping on
my daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I was
a Fishmonger: he is farre gone, farre gone: and truly in my
youth, I suffred much extreamity for loue: very neere
this.
Ile speake to him againe.
What do you read my
Lord?

+HAMLET
Words, words, words.

+POLONIUS
What is the matter, my Lord?

+HAMLET
Betweene who?

+POLONIUS
I meane the matter you meane, my Lord.

+HAMLET
Slanders Sir: for the Satyricall slaue saies here,
that old men haue gray Beards; that their faces are
wrinkled; their eyes purging thicke Amber, or Plum-Tree
Gumme: and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit, together
with weake Hammes.
All which Sir, though I most
powerfully, and potently beleeue; yet I holde it not
Honestie to haue it thus set downe: For you your selfe Sir, should
be old as I am, if like a Crab you could go backward.

+POLONIUS
Though this be madnesse, / Yet there
is Method in't: will you walke / Out of the ayre my Lord?

+HAMLET
Into my Graue?

+POLONIUS
Indeed that is out o'th' Ayre: How
pregnant [sometimes] his Replies are? / A happinesse, / That
often Madnesse hits on, / Which Reason and Sanitie could
not / So prosperously be deliuer'd of. / I will leaue him,
And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting / Betweene
him, and my daughter. / My Honourable Lord, I will
most humbly / Take my leaue of you.

+HAMLET
You cannot Sir take from me any thing, that I
will more willingly part withall, except my life,
my life.

+POLONIUS
Fare you well my Lord.

+HAMLET
These tedious old fooles.
SD: Enter +ROSANCRANCE and +GUILDENSTERN.

+POLONIUS
You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet; there hee is.

+ROSANCRANCE
God saue you Sir.

+GUILDENSTERN
Mine honour'd Lord?

+ROSANCRANCE
My most deare Lord?

+HAMLET
My excellent good friends?
How do'st thou Guildensterne?
Oh, Rosincrane;
good Lads: How doe ye both?

+ROSANCRANCE
As the indifferent Children of the earth.

+GUILDENSTERN
Happy, in that we are not ouer-happy:
on Fortunes Cap, we are not the very Button.

+HAMLET
Nor the Soales of her Shoo?

+ROSANCRANCE
Neither my Lord.

+HAMLET
Then you liue about her waste, or in the middle
of her fauour?

+GUILDENSTERN
Faith, her priuates, we.

+HAMLET
In the secret parts of Fortune?
Oh, most true:
she is a Strumpet.
What's the newes?

+ROSANCRANCE
None my Lord; but that the World's
growne honest.

+HAMLET
Then is Doomesday neere: But your newes is not
true.
Let me question more in particular: what haue
you my good friends, deserued at the hands of Fortune,
that she sends you to Prison hither?

+GUILDENSTERN
Prison, my Lord?

+HAMLET
Denmark's a Prison.

+ROSANCRANCE
Then is the World one.

+HAMLET
A goodly one, in which there are many Confines,
Wards, and Dungeons; Denmarke being one o'th'worst.

+ROSANCRANCE
We thinke not so my Lord.

+HAMLET
Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is
a prison.

+ROSANCRANCE
Why then your Ambition makes it one:
'tis too narrow for your minde.

+HAMLET
O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and
count my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not that I
haue bad dreames.

+GUILDENSTERN
Which dreames indeed are Ambition:
for the very substance of the Ambitious, is meerely the
shadow of a Dreame.

+HAMLET
A dreame it selfe is but a shadow.

+ROSANCRANCE
Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry and
light a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow.

+HAMLET
Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Monarchs
and out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes: shall
wee to th' Court: for, by my fey I cannot reason?

+ROSANCRANCE, +GUILDENSTERN
Wee'l wait vpon
you.

+HAMLET
No such matter.
I will not sort you with the rest
of my seruants: for to speake to you like an honest man:
I am most dreadfully attended; but in the beaten way
of friendship, What make you at Elsonower?

+ROSANCRANCE
To visit you my Lord, no other occasion.

+HAMLET
Begger that I am, I am euen poore in thankes;
but I thanke you: and sure deare friends my thanks are
too deare a halfepeny; were you not sent for?
Is it your
owne inclining?
Is it a free visitation?
Come, deale
iustly with me: come, come; nay speake.

+GUILDENSTERN
What should we say my Lord?

+HAMLET
Why any thing.
But to the purpose; you were
sent for; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes;
which your modesties haue not craft enough to color,
I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you.

+ROSANCRANCE
To what end my Lord?

+HAMLET
That you must teach me: but let mee coniure
you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy
of our youth, by the Obligation of our euer-preserued
loue, and by what more deare, a better proposer could charge
you withall; be euen and direct with me, whether you
were sent for or no.

+ROSANCRANCE
What say you?

+HAMLET
Nay then I haue an eye of you: if you
loue me hold not off.

+GUILDENSTERN
My Lord, we were sent for.

+HAMLET
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King
and Queene: moult no feather, I haue of late, but wherefore
I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome
of exercise; and indeed, it goes so heauenly with my
disposition; that this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to
me a sterrill Promontory; this most excellent Canopy
the Ayre, look you, this braue ore-hanging,
this Maiesticall Roofe, fretted with golden fire: why, it
appeares no other thing to mee, then a foule and pestilent congregation
of vapours.
What a piece of worke is a man!
how Noble in Reason? how infinite in faculty? in forme
and mouing how expresse and admirable? in Action, how
like an Angel? in apprehension, how like a God? the
beauty of the world, the Parragon of Animals; and yet
to me, what is this Quintessence of Dust? Man delights
not me; no, nor Woman neither; though by your smiling
you seeme to say so.

+ROSANCRANCE
My Lord, there was no such stuffe in my
thoughts.

+HAMLET
Why did you laugh, when I said, Man
delights not me?

+ROSANCRANCE
To thinke, my Lord, if you delight not in
Man, what Lenton entertainment the Players shall
receiue from you: wee coated them on the way, and
hither are they comming to offer you Seruice.

+HAMLET
He that playes the King shall be welcome; his
Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee: the aduenturous
Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Louer shall not
sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in
peace: the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs
are tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her minde
freely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Players
are they?

+ROSANCRANCE
Euen those you were wont to take
delight in / the Tragedians of the City.

+HAMLET
How chances it they trauaile? their residence
both in reputation and profit was better both wayes.

+ROSANCRANCE
I thinke their Inhibition comes by the
meanes of the late Innouation?

+HAMLET
Doe they hold the same estimation they did when
I was in the City?
Are they so follow'd?

+ROSANCRANCE
No indeed, they are not.

+HAMLET
How comes it? doe they grow rusty?

+ROSANCRANCE
Nay, their indeauour keepes in the wonted
pace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children, little Yases,
that crye out on the top of question; and are most tyrannically
clap't for't: these are now the fashion, and so
be-ratled the common Stages [so they call them] that
many wearing Rapiers, are affraide of Goose-quils, and dare
scarse come thither.

+HAMLET
What are they Children?
Who maintains 'em?
How are they escoted?
Will they pursue the Quality no
longer then they can sing?
Will they not say afterwards
if they should grow themselues to common Players [as
it is like most if their meanes are not better] their
Writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against
their owne Succession.

+ROSANCRANCE
Faith there ha's bene much to do on both
sides: and the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to
Controuersie.
There was for a while, no mony bid for
argument, vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes
in the Question.

+HAMLET
Is't possible?

+GUILDENSTERN
Oh there ha's beene much throwing about
of Braines.

+HAMLET
Do the Boyes carry it away?

+ROSANCRANCE
I that they do my Lord.
Hercules &
his load too.

+HAMLET
It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King of
Denmarke, and those that would make mowes at him
while my Father liued; giue twenty, forty, an hundred
Ducates a peece, for his picture in Little.
There is
something in this more then Naturall, if Philosophie could
finde it out.

SD: Flourish for the Players.

+GUILDENSTERN
There are the Players.

+HAMLET
Gentlemen, you are welcom to Elsonower: your
hands, come: The appurtenance of Welcome, is
Fashion and Ceremony.
Let me comply with you in the
Garbe, lest my extent to the Players [which I tell you must
shew fairely outward] should more appeare like entertainment
then yours.
You are welcome: but my Vnckle Father,
and Aunt Mother are deceiu'd.

+GUILDENSTERN
In what my deere Lord?

+HAMLET
I am but mad North, North-West: when the / Winde
is Southerly, I know a Hawke from a Handsaw.
SD: Enter +POLONIUS.

+POLONIUS
Well be with you Gentlemen.

+HAMLET
Hearke you Guildensterne, and you too: at each
eare a hearer: that great Baby you see there, is not yet
out of his swathing clouts.

+ROSANCRANCE
Happily he's the second time come to
them: for they say, an old man is twice a childe.

+HAMLET
I will Prophesie.
Hee comes to tell me of the
Players.
Mark it, you say right Sir: for a Monday morning
'twas so indeed.

+POLONIUS
My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you.

+HAMLET
My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you. / When Rossius
an Actor in Rome---

+POLONIUS
The Actors are come hither my Lord.

+HAMLET
Buzze, buzze.

+POLONIUS
Vpon mine Honor.

+HAMLET
Then can each Actor on his Asse---

+POLONIUS
The best Actors in the world, either for
Tragedie, Comedie, Historie, Pastorall: Pastoricall-Comicall-
Historicall-Pastorall: Tragicall-Historicall: Tragicall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:
Scene indiuidible: or Poem vnlimited.
Seneca cannot be too heauy, nor Plautus too
light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty.
These are the
onely men.

+HAMLET
O Iephta Iudge of Israel, what a Treasure
had'st thou?

+POLONIUS
What a Treasure had he, my Lord?

+HAMLET
Why
one faire Daughter, and no more,
The which he loued passing well.

+POLONIUS
Still on my Daughter.

+HAMLET
Am I not i'th'right old Iephta?

+POLONIUS
If you call me Iephta my Lord, I haue a
daughter that I loue passing well.

+HAMLET
Nay that followes not.

+POLONIUS
What followes then, my Lord?

+HAMLET
Why,
As by lot, God wot:
and then you know,
It came to passe, as most like it was:
The first rowe of the Pons Chanson will shew you more.
For looke where my Abridgements come.
SD: Enter foure or fiue PLAYERS.

+HAMLET
Y'are welcome Masters, welcome all.
I am glad to
see thee well: Welcome good Friends.
O my olde Friend?
Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last: Com'st
thou to beard me in Denmarke?
What, my yong Lady
and Mistris?
Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer
Heauen then when I saw you last, by the altitude of a
Choppine.
Pray God your voice like a peece of vncurrant
Gold be not crack'd within the ring.
Masters, you are
all welcome: wee'l e'ne to't like French Faulconers, flie
at any thing we see: wee'l haue a Speech straight.
Come
giue vs a tast of your quality: come, a passionate
speech.

+PLAYER 1
What speech, my Lord?

+HAMLET
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
neuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play I
remember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas Cauiarie to the
Generall: but it was [as I receiu'd it, and others, whose
iudgement in such matters, cried in the top of mine]
an excellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downe
with as much modestie, as cunning.
I remember one said,
there was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter
sauouty; nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite
the Author of affectation, but cal'd it an honest method.
One cheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou'd, 'twas
Aeneas Tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially,
where he speaks of Priams slaughter.
If it liue in your
memory, begin at this Line, let me see, let me see:
The rugged Pyrrhus like th' Hyrcanian Beast.
It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus
The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose Sable Armes
Blacke as his purpose, did the night resemble
When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse,
Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd
With Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote
Now is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick'd
With blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes,
Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
That lend a tyrannous, and damned light
To their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire,
And thus o're-sized with coagulate gore,
With eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
Olde Grandsire Priam seekes.

+POLONIUS
Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good
accent, and good discretion.

+PLAYER 1
Anon he findes him,
Striking too short at Greekes.
His anticke Sword,
Rebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles
Repugnant to command: vnequall match,
Pyrrhus at Priam driues, in Rage strikes wide:
But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,
Th'vnnerued Father fals.
Then senselesse Illium,
Seeming to feele his blow, with flaming top
Stoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crash
Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare.
For loe, his Sword
Which was declining on the Milkie head
Of Reuerend Priam, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke:
So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood,
And like a Newtrall to his will and matter,
did nothing.
But as we often see against some storme,
A silence in the Heauens, the Racke stand still,
The bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe below
As hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder
Doth rend the Region.
So after Pyrrhus pause,
A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke,
And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall
On Mars his Armours, forg'd for proofe Eterne,
With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword
Now falles on Priam.
Out, out, thou Strumpet-Fortune, all you Gods,
In generall Synod take away her power:
Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,
And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,
As low as to the Fiends.

+POLONIUS
This is too long.

+HAMLET
It shall to'th Barbars, with your beard.
Prythee say on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Baudry, or hee
sleepes.
Say on; come to Hecuba.

+PLAYER 1
But who, O who, had seen the inobled Queen.

+HAMLET
The inobled Queene?

+POLONIUS
That's good: Inobled Queene is good.

+PLAYER 1
Run bare-foot vp and downe, / Threatning the flame
With Bisson Rheume: A clout about that head,
Where late the Diadem stood, and for a Robe
About her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines,
A blanket in th' Alarum of feare caught vp.
Who this had seene, with tongue in Venome steep'd,
'Gainst Fortunes State, would Treason haue pronounc'd?
But if the Gods themselues did see her then,
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,
The instant Burst of Clamour that she made
[Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all]
Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen,
And passion in the Gods.

+POLONIUS
Looke where he ha's not turn'd his colour,
and ha's teares in's eyes.
Pray you no more.

+HAMLET
'Tis well, Ile haue thee speake out the rest,
soone.
Good my Lord, will you see the Players wel
bestow'd.
Do ye heare, let them be well vs'd: for
they are the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time.
After your death, you were better haue a bad Epitaph,
then their ill report while you liued.

+POLONIUS
My Lord, I will vse them according to their
desart.

+HAMLET
Gods bodykins man, better.
Vse euerie
man after his desart, and who should scape whipping:
vse them after your own Honor and Dignity.
The lesse
they deserue, the more merit is in your bountie.
Take
them in.

+POLONIUS
Come sirs.
SD: POLONIUS exits

+HAMLET
Follow him Friends: wee'l heare a play to morrow.
Dost thou heare me old
Friend, can you play the murther of Gonzago?

+PLAYER
I my Lord.

+HAMLET
Wee'l ha't to morrow night.
You could for a
need study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines,
which I would set downe, and insert in't?
Could ye not?

+PLAYER
I my Lord.

+HAMLET
Very well.
Follow that Lord, and looke you mock
him not.
My good Friends, Ile leaue you til night / you are welcome
to Elsonower?

+ROSANCRANCE
Good my Lord.

+HAMLET
I so, God buy'ye:
SD: +ROSANCRANCE, +GUILDENSTERN and Players Exeunt
SD: Manet +HAMLET

+HAMLET
Now I am alone.
Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I?
Is it not monstrous that this Player heere,
But in a Fixion, in a dreame of Passion,
Could force his soule so to his whole conceit,
That from her working, all his visage warm'd;
Teares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect,
A broken voyce, and his whole Function suiting
With Formes, to his Conceit?
And all for nothing?
For Hecuba?
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should weepe for her?
What would he doe,
Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion
That I haue?
He would drowne the Stage with teares,
And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech:
Make mad the guilty, and apale the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,
The very faculty of Eyes and Eares.
Yet I,
A dull and muddy-metled Rascall, peake
Like Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing: No, not for a King,
Vpon whose property, and most deere life,
A damn'd defeate was made.
Am I a Coward?
Who calles me Villaine? breakes my pate a-crosse?
Pluckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face?
Tweakes me by'th'Nose? giues me the Lye i'th'Throate,
As deepe as to the Lungs?
Who does me this?
Ha?
Why I should take it: for it cannot be,
But I am Pigeon-Liuer'd, and lacke Gall
To make Oppression bitter, or ere this,
I should haue fatted all the Region



NS: Act 3 Scene 1

SD: Enter +KING, +QUEENE, +POLONIUS, +OPHELIA, +ROSINCRANCE, +GUILDENSTERN, and Lords.

+KING
And can you by no drift of circumstance
Get from him why he puts on this Confusion:
Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy.

+ROSIN
He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted,
But from what cause he will by no meanes speake.

+GUILD
Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded,
But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe:
When we would bring him on to some Confession
Of his true state.

+QUEENE
Did he receiue you well?

+ROSIN
Most like a Gentleman.

+GUILD
But with much forcing of his disposition.

+ROSIN
Niggard of question, but of our demands
Most free in his reply.

+QUEENE
Did you assay him
to any pastime?

+ROSIN
Madam, it so fell out, that certaine Players
We ore-wrought on the way: of these we told him,
And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy
To heare of it: They are about the Court,
And [as I thinke] they haue already order
This night to play before him.

+POLONIUS
'Tis most true:
And he beseech'd me to intreate your Maiesties
To heare, and see the matter.

+KING
With all my heart, and it doth much content me
To heare him so inclin'd.
Good Gentlemen, / Giue him a further edge,
and driue his purpose on / To these delights.

+ROSIN
We shall my Lord.

SD: +ROSIN exits, +GUILD exits
KING
Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too,
For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may there
Affront OPHELIA.
Her Father, and my selfe [lawful espials]
Will so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseene
We may of their encounter frankely iudge,
And gather by him, as he is behaued,
If't be th'affliction of his loue, or no.
That thus he suffers for.

+QUEENE
I shall obey you,
And for your part OPHELIA, I do wish
That your good Beauties be the happy cause
Of Hamlets wildenesse: so shall I hope your Vertues
Will bring him to his wonted way againe,
To both your Honors.

+OPHELIA
Madam, I wish it may.

+POLONIUS
OPHELIA, walke you heere. Gracious so please ye
We will bestow our selues: Reade on this booke,
That shew of such an exercise may colour
Your lonelinesse. We are oft too blame in this,
'Tis too much prou'd, that with Deuotions visage,
And pious Action, we do surge o're
The diuell himselfe.

+KING
Oh 'tis true:
How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience?
The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist'ring Art
Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it,
Then is my deede, to my most painted word.
Oh heauie burthen!

+POLONIUS
I heare him comming, let's withdraw my Lord.

SD: +POLONIUS exits, +KING exits

SD: Enter +HAMLET.

+HAMLET
To be, or not to be, that is the Question:
Whether 'tis Nobler in the minde to suffer
The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,
Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe
No more; and by a sleepe, to say we end
The Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall shockes
That Flesh is heyre too? 'Tis a consummation
Deuoutly to be wish'd. To dye to sleepe,
To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rub,
For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,
When we haue shufflel'd off this mortall coile,
Must giue vs pawse. There's the respect
That makes Calamity of so long life:
For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,
The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,
The pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay,
The insolence of Office, and the Spurnes
That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,
When he himselfe might his Quietus make
With a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beare
To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The vndiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne
No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,
And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,
Then flye to others that we know not of.
Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,
And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution
Is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought,
And enterprizes of great pith and moment,
With this regard their Currants turne away,
And loose the name of Action. Soft you now,
The faire OPHELIA? Nimph, in thy Orizons
Be all my sinnes remembred.

+OPHELIA
Good my Lord,
How does your Honor for this many a day?

+HAMLET
I humbly thanke you: well, well, well.

+OPHELIA
My Lord, I haue Remembrances of yours,
That I haue longed long to re-deliuer.
I pray you now, receiue them.

+HAMLET
No, no,
I neuer gaue you ought.

+OPHELIA
My honor'd Lord, I know right well you did,
And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd,
As made the things more rich, then perfume left:
Take these againe, for to the Noble minde
Rich gifts wax poore, when giuers proue vnkinde.
There my Lord.

+HAMLET
Ha, ha: Are you honest?

+OPHELIA
My Lord.

+HAMLET
Are you faire?

+OPHELIA
What meanes your Lordship?

+HAMLET
That if you be honest and faire, your Honesty
should admit no discourse to your Beautie.

+OPHELIA
Could Beautie my Lord, haue better Comerce
then your Honestie?

+HAMLET
I trulie: for the power of Beautie, will sooner
transforme Honestie from what it is, to a Bawd, then the
force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse.
This was sometime a Paradox, but now the time giues it
proofe. I did loue you once.

+OPHELIA
Indeed my Lord, you made me beleeue so.

+HAMLET
You should not haue beleeued me. For vertue
cannot so innocculate our old stocke, but we shall rellish of
it. I loued you not.

+OPHELIA
I was the more deceiued.

+HAMLET
Get thee to a Nunnerie. Why would'st thou be a
breeder of Sinners? I am my selfe indifferent honest, but
yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better
my Mother had not borne me. I am very prowd, reuengefull,
Ambitious, with more offences at my becke, then I
haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giue them
shape, or time to acte them in. What should such Fellowes
as I do, crawling betweene Heauen and Earth. We are
arrant Knaues all, beleeue none of vs. Goe thy wayes to a
Nunnery. Where's your Father?

+OPHELIA
At home, my Lord.

+HAMLET
Let the doores be shut vpon him, that he may
play the Foole no way, but in's owne house. Farewell.

+OPHELIA
O helpe him, you sweet Heauens.

+HAMLET
If thou doest Marry, Ile giue thee this Plague for
thy Dowrie. Be thou as chast as Ice, as pure as Snow,
thou shalt not escape Calumny. Get thee to a Nunnery.
Go, Farewell. Or if thou wilt needs Marry, marry a fool:
for Wise men know well enough, what monsters you
make of them. To a Nunnery go, and quickly too.
Farwell.

+OPHELIA
O heauenly Powers, restore him.

+HAMLET
I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough.
God has giuen you one pace, and you make your selfe
another: you gidge, you amble, and you lispe, and nickname
Gods creatures, and make your Wantonnesse, your
Ignorance. Go too, Ile no more on't, it hath made me
mad. I say, we will haue no more Marriages. Those that
are married already, all but one shall liue, the rest
shall keep as they are. To a Nunnery, go.

O what a Noble minde is heere o're-throwne?
The Courtiers, Soldiers, Schollers: Eye, tongue, sword,
Th'expectansie and Rose of the faire State,
The glasse of Fashion, and the mould of Forme,
Th'obseru'd of all Obseruers, quite, quite downe.
Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched,
That suck'd the Honie of his Musicke Vowes:
Now see that Noble, and most Soueraigne Reason,
Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune, and harsh,
That vnmatch'd Forme and Feature of blowne youth,
Blasted with extasie. Oh woe is me,
T'haue seene what I haue seene: see what I see.

SD: Enter +KING, and +POLONIUS.

+KING
Loue? His affections do not that way tend,
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd Forme a little,
Was not like Madnesse. There's something in his soule?
O're which his Melancholly sits on brood,
And I do doubt the hatch, and the disclose
Will be some danger, which to preuent
I haue in quicke determination
Thus set it downe. He shall with speed to England
For the demand of our neglected Tribute:
Haply the Seas and Countries different
With variable Obiects, shall expell
This something setled matter in his heart:
Whereon his Braines still beating, puts him thus
From fashion of himselfe. What thinke you on't?

+POLONIUS
It shall do well. But yet do I beleeue
The Origin and Commencement of this greefe
Sprung from neglected loue. How now OPHELIA?
You neede not tell vs, what Lord Hamlet saide,
We heard it all. My Lord, do as you please,
But if you hold it fit after the Play,
Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him
To shew his Greefes: let her be round with him,
And Ile be plac'd so, please you in the eare
Of all their Conference. If she finde him not,
To England send him: Or confine him where
Your wisedome best shall thinke.

+KING
It shall be so:
Madnesse in great Ones, must not vnwatch'd go.

NS: Act 3 Scene 2

SD: Enter +HAMLET, and two or three of the Players.

+HAMLET

Speake the Speech I pray you, as I pronounc'd
it to you trippingly on the Tongue: But if you mouth it,
as many of your Players do, I had as liue the Town-Cryer
had spoke my Lines: Nor do not saw the Ayre too much
your hand thus, but vse all gently; for in the verie Torrent,
Tempest, and [as I may say] the Whirle-winde of
Passion, you must acquire and beget a Temperance that
may giue it Smoothnesse. O it offends mee to the Soule, to
see a robustious Pery-wig-pated Fellow, teare a Passion to
tatters, to verie ragges, to split the eares of the Groundlings:
who [for the most part] are capeable of nothing, but
inexplicable dumbe shewes, & noise: I could haue such a
Fellow whipt for o're-doing Termagant: it out- Herod's
Herod. Pray you auoid it.

+PLAYER

I warrant your Honor.

+HAMLET

Be not too tame neyther: but let your owne Discretion
be your Tutor. Sute the Action to the Word, the
Word to the Action, with this speciall obseruance: That
you ore-stop not the modestie of Nature; for any thing so
ouer-done, is frõ the purpose of Playing, whose end
both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twer
the Mirrour vp to Nature; to shew Vertue her owne Feature,
Scorne her owne Image, and the verie Age and Bodie of the
Time, his forme and pressure. Now, this ouer-done, or come
tardie off, though it make the vnskilfull laugh, cannot
but make the Iudicious greeue; The censure of the which
One, must in your allowance o're-way a whole Theater
of Others. Oh, there bee Players that I haue seene Play, and
heard others praise, and that highly [not to speake it
prophanely] that neyther hauing the accent of Christians,
nor the gate of Christian, Pagan, or Norman, haue so
strutted and bellowed, that I haue thought some of
Natures Iouerney-men had made men, and not made
them well, they imitated Humanity so abhominably.

+PLAYER

I hope we haue reform'd that indifferently
with vs, Sir.

+HAMLET

O reforme it altogether. And let those that play
your Clownes, speake no more then is set downe for them.
For there be of them, that will themselues laugh, to set on
some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh too, though
in the meane time, some necessary Question of the Play be
then to be considered: that's Villanous, & shewes a
most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses it.

+HAMLET
Go make you readie.

Heere sweet Lord, at your Seruice.

+HAMLET

Horatio, thou art eene as iust a man
As ere my Conuersation coap'd withall.

+HORATIO

O my deere Lord.

+HAMLET

Nay, do not thinke I flatter:
For what aduancement may I hope from thee,
That no Reuennew hast, but thy good spirits
To feed & cloath thee. Why shold the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the Candied tongue, like absurd pompe,
And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee,
Where thrift may follow faining? Dost thou heare,
Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse,
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath seal'd thee for her selfe. For thou hast bene
As one in suffering all, that suffers nothing.
A man that Fortunes buffets, and Rewards
Hath 'tane with equall Thankes. And blest are those,
Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co-mingled,
That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger,
To sound what stop she please. Giue me that man,
That is not Passions Slaue, and I will weare him
In my hearts Core: I, in my Heart of heart,
As I do thee. Something too much of this.
There is a Play to night before the King,
One Scoene of it comes neere the Circumstance
Which I haue told thee, of my Fathers death.
I prythee, when thou see'st that Acte a-foot,
Euen with the verie Comment of my Soule
Obserue mine Vnkle: If his occulted guilt,
Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech,
It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene:
And my Imaginations are as foule
As Vulcans Stythe. Giue him needfull note,
For I mine eyes will riuet to his Face:
And after we will both our iudgements ioyne,
To censure of his seeming.

+HORATIO

Well my Lord.
If he steale ought the whil'st this Play is Playing,
And scape detecting, I will pay the Theft.

+HAMLET

They are comming to the Play: I must be idle. Get
you a place.

+KING

How fares our Cosin Hamlet?

+HAMLET

Excellent Ifaith, of the Camelions dish: I eate
the Ayre promise-cramm'd, you cannot feed Capons so.

+KING

I haue nothing with this answer Hamlet, these
words are not mine.

+HAMLET

No, nor mine. Now my Lord, you
plaid once i'th'Vniuersity, you say?

+POLONIUS

That I did my Lord, and was accounted a
good Actor.

+HAMLET

And what did you enact?

+POLONIUS

I did enact Iulius Casar, I was kill'd
i'th'Capitol: Brutus kill'd me.

+HAMLET

It was a bruite part of him, to kill so Capitall a Calfe
there. Be the Players ready?

+ROSINCRANCE

I my Lord, they stay vpon your
patience.

+QUEEN

Come hither my good Hamlet, sit by me.

+HAMLET

No good Mother, here's Mettle more attractiue.

+POLONIUS

Oh ho, do you marke that?

+HAMLET

Ladie, shall I lye in your Lap?

+OPHELIA

No my Lord.

+HAMLET

I meane, my Head vpon your Lap?

+OPHELIA

+HAMLET

Do you thinke I meant Country matters?

+OPHELIA

I thinke nothing, my Lord.

+HAMLET

That's a faire thought to ly between Maids
legs

+OPHELIA

What is my Lord?

+HAMLET

Nothing.

+OPHELIA

You are merrie, my Lord?

+HAMLET

Who I?

+OPHELIA

I my Lord.

+HAMLET

Oh God, your onely Iigge-maker: what should a
man do, but be merrie. For looke you how cheerefully my
Mother lookes, and my Father dyed within's two Houres.

+OPHELIA

Nay, 'tis twice two moneths, my Lord.

+HAMLET

So long? Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke, for
Ile haue a suite of Sables. Oh Heauens! dye two moneths
ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope, a great
mans Memorie, may out-liue his life halfe a yeare: But
byrlady he must builde Churches then: or else shall he suffer
not thinking on, with the Hoby-horsse, whose Epitaph
is, For o, For o, the Hoby-horse is forgot.

SD: Hoboyes play.

She kneeles, and makes shew of Protestation vntohim. +HE takes her vp, and dcclines his head vpon her neck. Layes him downe vpon a Banke of Flowers. +SHE seeing him a-sleepe, leaues him. Anon comes in a Fellow, takes off hisCrowne, kisses it, and powres poyson in the Kings eares, andExits. The Queene returnes, findes the King dead, andmakes passionate Action. The Poysoner, with some two orthree Mutes comes in againe, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away: The Poysoner Wooes the Queene with Gifts, she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile, but in the end, accepts his loue.

+HAMLET

Marry this is Miching Malicho, that meanes
Mischeefe.

Belike this shew imports the Argument of the
Play?

+HAMLET

We shall know by these Fellowes: the Players cannot
keepe counsell, they'l tell all.

+OPHELIA

Will they tell vs what this shew meant?

+HAMLET

I, or any shew that you'l shew him. Bee not
you asham'd to shew, hee'l not shame to tell you what
it meanes.

+OPHELIA

You are naught, you are naught, Ile marke the
Play.

SD: Enter Prologue.

For vs, and for our Tragedie,
Heere stooping to your Clemencie:
We begge your hearing Patientlie.

+HAMLET

Is this a Prologue, or the Poesie of a Ring?

+OPHELIA

'Tis briefe my Lord.

+HAMLET

As Womans loue.

SD: Enter King and his Queene.

+KING

Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round,
Neptunes salt Wash, and Tellus Orbed ground:
And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene,
About the World haue times twelue thirties beene,
Since loue our hearts, and Hymen did our hands
Vnite comutuall, in most sacred Bands.

+BAPTISTA

So many iournies may the Sunne and Moone
Make vs againe count o're, ere loue be done.
But woe is me, you are so sicke of late,
So farre from cheere, and from your forme state,
That I distrust you: yet though I distrust,
Discomfort you [my Lord] it nothing must:
For womens Feare and Loue, holds quantitie,
In neither ought, or in extremity:
Now what my loue is, proofe hath made you know,
And as my Loue is siz'd, my Feare is so.

+KING

Faith I must leaue thee Loue, and shortly too:
My operant Powers my Functions leaue to do:
And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde,
Honour'd, belou'd, and haply, one as kinde.
For Husband shalt thou-----

+BAPTISTA

Oh confound the rest:
Such Loue, must needs be Treason in my brest:
In second Husband, let me be accurst,
None wed the second, but who kill'd the first.

+HAMLET

Wormwood, Wormwood.

+BAPTISTA

The instances that second Marriage moue,
Are base respects of Thrift, but none of Loue.
A second time, I kill my Husband dead,
When second Husband kisses me in Bed.

+KING

I do beleeue you. Think what now you speak:
But what we do determine, oft we breake:
Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie,
Of violent Birth, but poore validitie:
Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree,
But fall vnshaken, when they mellow bee.
Most necessary 'tis, that we forget
To pay our selues, what to our selues is debt:
What to our selues in passion we propose,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of other Greefe or Ioy,
Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy:
Where Ioy most Reuels, Greefe doth most lament;
Greefe ioyes, Ioy greeues on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change.
For 'tis a question left vs yet to proue,
Whether Loue lead Fortune, or else Fortune Loue.
The great man downe, you marke his fauourites flies,
The poore aduanc'd, makes Friends of Enemies:
And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend,
For who not needs, shall neuer lacke a Frend:
And who in want a hollow Friend doth try,
Directly seasons him his Enemie.
But orderly to end, where I begun,
Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run,
That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne,
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our owne.
So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed.
But die thy thoughts, when thy first Lord is dead.

+BAPTISTA

Nor Earth to giue me food, nor Heauen light,
Sport and repose locke from me day and night:
Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy,
Meet what I would haue well, and it destroy:
Both heere, and hence, pursue me lasting strife,
If once a Widdow, euer I be Wife.

+HAMLET

If she should breake it now.

+KING

'Tis deepely sworne: / Sweet, leaue me heere a while,
My spirits grow dull, and faine I would beguile
The tedious day with sleepe.

+QUEEN

Sleepe rocke thy Braine,
And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine.

Haue you heard the Argument, is there no Offence
in't?

+HAMLET

No, no, they do but iest, poyson in iest, no
Offence i'th'world.

+KING

What do you call the Play?

+HAMLET

The Mouse-trap: Marry how? Tropically: This
Play is the Image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago
is the Dukes name, his wife Baptista: you shall see
anon: 'tis a knauish peece of worke: But what o'that?
Your Maiestie, and wee that haue free soules, it touches vs
not: let the gall'd iade winch: our withers are vnrung.

SD: Enter Lucianus.

+HAMLET

This is one Lucianus nephew to the King.

+OPHELIA

You are a good Chorus, my Lord.

+HAMLET

I could interpret betweene you and your loue: if
I could see the Puppets dallying.

+OPHELIA

You are keene my Lord, you are keene.

+HAMLET

It would cost you a groaning, to take off my
edge.

+OPHELIA

Still better and worse.

+HAMLET

So you mistake Husbands. / Begin Murderer.
Pox, leaue thy damnable Faces, and begin. Come,
the croaking Rauen doth bellow for Reuenge.

+LUCIANUS

Thoughts blacke, hands apt, / Drugges fit, and Time agreeing:
Confederate season, else, no Creature seeing:
Thou mixture ranke, of Midnight Weeds collected,
With Hecats Ban, thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thy naturall Magicke, and dire propertie,
On wholsome life, vsurpe immediately.

SD: Powres the poyson in his eares.

+HAMLET

He poysons him i'th'Garden for's estate: His
name's Gonzago: the Story is extant and writ in
choyce Italian. You shall see anon how the Murtherer
gets the loue of Gonzago's wife.

+OPHELIA

The King rises.

+HAMLET

What, frighted with false fire.

For some must watch, while some must sleepe;
So runnes the world away.
Would not this Sir, and a Forrest of Feathers, if the rest
of my Fortunes tutne Turke with me; with two Prouinciall
Roses on my rac'd Shooes, get me a Fellowship in a crie of
Players sir.

+HORATIO

Halfe a share.

For thou dost know: Oh Damon deere,
This Realme dismantled was

A verie verie Paiocke.

Oh good Horatio, Ile take the Ghosts word for a

Why then belike he likes it not perdie.
Come some Musicke.

+HAMLET

Sir, a whole History.

+GUILDENSTERNE

The King, sir.

+HAMLET

I sir, what of him?

+GUILDENSTERNE

Is in his retyrement, maruellous
distemper'd.

+HAMLET

With drinke Sir?

+GUILDENSTERNE

No my Lord, rather with choller.

+HAMLET

Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer, to
signifie this to his Doctor: for for me to put him to his
Purgation, would perhaps plundge him into farre more Choller.

+GUILDENSTERNE

my Lord put your discourse into
some frame, and start not so wildely from my affayre.

+HAMLET

I am tame Sir, pronounce.

+GUILDENSTERNE

The Queene your Mother, in most great
affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.

+HAMLET

You are welcome.

+GUILDENSTERNE

Nay, good my Lord, this courtesie is not
of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a
wholsome answer, I will doe your Mothers command'ment:
if not, your pardon, and my returne shall bee the
end of my Businesse.

+HAMLET

Sir, I cannot.

+GUILDENSTERNE

What, my Lord?

+HAMLET

Make you a wholsome answere: my wits
diseas'd. But sir, such answers as I can make, you shal
command: or rather you say, my Mother: therfore
no more but to the matter. My Mother you say.

+ROSINCRANCE

Then thus she sayes: your behauior hath
stroke her into amazement, and admiration.

+HAMLET

Oh wonderfull Sonne, that can so astonish a Mother.
But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mothers
admiration?

+ROSINCRANCE

She desires to speake with you in her
Closset, ere you go to bed.

+HAMLET

We shall obey, were she ten times our Mother.
Haue you any further Trade with vs?

+ROSINCRANCE

My Lord, you once did loue me.

+HAMLET

So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.

+ROSINCRANCE

Good my Lord, what is your cause of distemper?
You do freely barre the doore of your owne
Libertie, if you deny your greefes to your Friend.

+HAMLET

Sir I lacke Aduancement.

+ROSINCRANCE

How can that be, when you haue the
voyce of the King himselfe, for your Succession in
Denmarke?

+HAMLET

I, but while the grasse growes, the Prouerbe
is something musty.

SD: Enter one with a Recorder.

+HAMLET

O the Recorder. Let me see, to withdraw with
you, why do you go about to recouer the winde of mee, as
if you would driue me into a toyle?

+GUILDENSTERNE

O my Lord, if my Dutie be too bold, my
loue is too vnmannerly.

+HAMLET

I do not well vnderstand that. Will you play
vpon this Pipe?

+GUILDENSTERNE

My Lord, I cannot.

+HAMLET

I pray you.

+GUILDENSTERNE

Beleeue me, I cannot.

+HAMLET

I do beseech you.

+GUILDENSTERNE

I know no touch of it, my Lord.

+HAMLET

'Tis as easie as lying: gouerne these Ventiges with
your finger and thumbe, giue it breath with your mouth,
and it will discourse most excellent Musicke. Looke you,
these are the stoppes.

+GUILDENSTERNE

But these cannot I command to any
vtterance of hermony, I haue not the skill.

+HAMLET

Why looke you now, how vnworthy a thing you
make of me: you would play vpon mee; you would seeme
to know my stops: you would pluck out the heart of my
Mysterie; you would sound mee from my lowest Note, to
the top of my Compasse: and there is much Musicke, excellent
Voice, in this little Organe, yet cannot you make it.
Why do you thinke, that I am easier to bee plaid
on, then a Pipe? Call me what Instrument you will,
though you can fret me, you cannot play vpon me.

SD: Enter POLONIUS.

+POLONIUS

God blesse you Sir.

Do you see that Clowd? that's almost in shape
like a Camell.

+POLONIUS

By'th'Misse, and it's like a Camell indeed.

+HAMLET

Me thinkes it is like a Weazell.

+POLONIUS

It is back'd like a Weazell.

+HAMLET

Or like a Whale?

+POLONIUS

Verie like a Whale.

+HAMLET

Then will I come to my Mother, by and by:
They foole me to the top of my bent. / I will
come by and by.

+POLONIUS

I will say so.

+HAMLET
By and by, is easily said.

SD: POLONIUS exits.

+HAMLET

Leaue me Friends:
'Tis now the verie witching time of night,
When Churchyards yawne, and Hell it selfe breaths out
Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,
And do such bitter businesse as the day
Would quake to looke on. Soft now, to my Mother:
Oh Heart, loose not thy Nature; let not euer
The Soule of Nero, enter this firme bosome:
Let me be cruell, not vnnaturall,
I will speake Daggers to her, but vse none:
My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites.
How in my words someuer she be shent,
To giue them Seales, neuer my Soule consent.

+KING

I like him not, nor stands it safe with vs,
To let his madnesse range. Therefore prepare you,
I your Commission will forthwith dispatch,
And he to England shall along with you:
The termes of our estate, may not endure
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourely grow
Out of his Lunacies.

+GUILDENSTERNE

We will our selues prouide:
Most holie and Religious feare it is
To keepe those many many bodies safe
That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie.

+ROSINCRANCE

The single / And peculiar life is bound
With all the strength and Armour of the minde,
To keepe it selfe from noyance: but much more,
That Spirit, vpon whose spirit depends and rests
The liues of many, the cease of Maiestie
Dies not alone; but like a Gulfe doth draw
What's neere it, with it. It is a massie wheele
Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount,
To whose huge Spoakes, ten thousand lesser things
Are mortiz'd and adioyn'd: which when it falles,
Each small annexment, pettie consequence
Attends the boystrous Ruine. Neuer alone
Did the King sighe, but with a generall grone.

+KING

Arme you, I pray you to this speedie Voyage;
For we will Fetters put vpon this feare,
Which now goes too free-footed.

+ROSINCRANCE, +GUILDENSTERNE
We will haste vs.

SD: Exeunt ROSINCRANCE, GUILDENSTERNE

SD: Enter POLONIUS.

+POLONIUS

My Lord, he's going to his Mothers Closset:
Behinde the Arras Ile conuey my selfe
To heare the Processe. Ile warrant shee'l tax him home,
And as you said, and wisely was it said,
'Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother,
Since Nature makes them partiall, should o're-heare
The speech of vantage. Fare you well my Liege,
Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed,
And tell you what I know.

+KING

Thankes deere my Lord.
Oh my offence is ranke, it smels to heauen,
It hath the primall eldest curse vpon't,
A Brothers murther. Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as sharpe as will:
My stronger guilt, defeats my strong intent,
And like a man to double businesse bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect; what if this cursed hand
Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood,
Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens
To wash it white as Snow? Whereto serues mercy,
But to confront the visage of Offence?
And what's in Prayer, but this two-fold force,
To be fore-stalled ere we come to fall,
Or pardon'd being downe? Then Ile looke vp,
My fault is past. But oh, what forme of Prayer
Can serue my turne? Forgiue me my foule Murther:
That cannot be, since I am still possest
Of those effects for which I did the Murther.
My Crowne, mine owne Ambition, and my Queene:
May one be pardon'd, and retaine th'offence?
In the corrupted currants of this world,
Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice,
And oft 'tis seene, the wicked prize it selfe
Buyes out the Law; but 'tis not so aboue,
There is no shuffling, there the Action lyes
In his true Nature, and we our selues compell'd
Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To giue in euidence. What then? What rests?
Try what Repentance can. What can it not?
Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?
Oh wretched state! Oh bosome, blacke as death!
Oh limed soule, that strugling to be free,
Art more ingag'd: Helpe Angels, make assay:
Bow stubborne knees, and heart with strings of Steele,
Be soft as sinewes of the new-borne Babe,
All may be well.

SD: Enter HAMLET.

+HAMLET

Now might I do it pat, now he is praying,
And now Ile doo't, and so he goes to Heauen,
And so am I reueng'd: that would be scann'd,
A Villaine killes my Father, and for that
I his foule Sonne, do this same Villaine send
To heauen.
Oh this is hyre and Sallery, not Reuenge.
He tooke my Father grossely, full of bread,
With all his Crimes broad blowne, as fresh as May,
And how his Audit stands, who knowes, saue Heauen:
But in our circumstance and course of thought
'Tis heauie with him: and am I then reueng'd,
To take him in the purging of his Soule,
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
No.
Vp Sword, and know thou a more horrid hent
When he is drunke asleepe: or in his Rage,
Or in th'incestuous pleasure of his bed,
At gaming, swearing, or about some acte
That ha's no rellish of Saluation in't,
Then trip him, that his heeles may kicke at Heauen,
And that his Soule may be as damn'd aud blacke
As Hell, whereto it goes. My Mother stayes,
This Physicke but prolongs thy sickly dayes.

SD: HAMLET exits.

+KING

My words flye vp, my thoughts remain below,
Words without thoughts, neuer to Heauen go.

SD: KING exits.




NS: Act 3 Scene 4

SD: Enter +QUEENE and +POLONIUS.
+POLONIUS
He will come straight: / Looke you lay home to him,
Tell him his prankes haue been too broad to beare with,
And that your Grace hath scree'nd, and stoode betweene
Much heate, and him. Ile silence me e'ene heere:
Pray you be round with him.
+HAMLET
within.
Mother, mother, mother.
+QUEENE
Ile warrant you, feare me not. / Withdraw, I heare
him comming.
SD: Enter +HAMLET.
+HAMLET
Now Mother, what's the matter?
+QUEENE
Hamlet, thou hast thy Father much offended.
+HAMLET
Mother, you haue my Father much offended.
+QUEENE
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
+HAMLET
Go, go, you question with an idle tongue.
+QUEENE
Why how now Hamlet?
+HAMLET
Whats the matter now?
+QUEENE
Haue you forgot me?
+HAMLET
No by the Rood, not so:
You are the Queene, your Husbands Brothers wife,
But would you were not so. You are my Mother.
+QUEENE
Nay, then Ile set those to you that can speake.
+HAMLET
Come, come, and sit you downe, you shall not boudge:
You go not till I set you vp a glasse,
Where you may see the inmost part of you?
+QUEENE
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murther me?
Helpe, helpe, hoa.
+POLONIUS
What hoa, helpe, helpe, helpe.
+HAMLET
How now, a Rat? dead for a Ducate, dead.
SD: +HAMLET Killes +POLONIUS.
+POLONIUS
Oh I am slaine.
+QUEENE
Oh me, what hast thou done?
+HAMLET
Nay I know not, is it the King?
+QUEENE
Oh what a rash, and bloody deed is this?
+HAMLET
A bloody deed, almost as bad good Mother,
As kill a King, and marrie with his Brother.
+QUEENE
As kill a King?
+HAMLET
I Lady, 'twas my word.
Thou wretched, rash, intruding foole farewell,
I tooke thee for thy Betters, take thy Fortune,
Thou find'st to be too busie, is some danger.
Leaue wringing of your hands, peace, sit you downe,
And let me wring your heart, for so I shall
If it be made of penetrable stuffe;
If damned Custome haue not braz'd it so,
That it is proofe and bulwarke against Sense.
+QUEENE
What haue I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tong,
In noise so rude against me?
+HAMLET
Such an Act
That blurres the grace and blush of Modestie,
Cals Vertue Hypocrite, takes off the Rose
From the faire forehead of an innocent loue,
And makes a blister there. Makes marriage vowes
As false as Dicers Oathes. Oh such a deed,
As from the body of Contraction pluckes
The very soule, and sweete Religion makes
A rapsidie of words. Heauens face doth glow,
Yea this solidity and compound masse,
With tristfull visage as against the doome,
Is thought-sicke at the act.
+QUEENE
Aye me; what act,
that roares so lowd, & thunders in the Index.
+HAMLET
Looke heere vpon this Picture, and on this,
The counterfet presentment of two Brothers:
See what a grace was seated on his Brow,
Hyperions curles, the front of Ioue himselfe,
An eye like Mars, to threaten or command
A Station, like the Herald Mercurie
New lighted on a heauen-kissing hill:
A Combination, and a forme indeed,
Where euery God did seeme to set his Seale,
To giue the world assurance of a man.
This was your Husband. Looke you now what followes.
Heere is your Husband, like a Mildew'd eare
Blasting his wholsom breath. Haue you eyes?
Could you on this faire Mountaine leaue to feed,
And batten on this Moore? Ha? Haue you eyes?
You cannot call it Loue: For at your age,
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
And waites vpon the Iudgement: and what Iudgement
Would step from this, to this?
What diuell was't,
That thus hath cousend you at hoodman-blinde?
O Shame! where is thy Blush? Rebellious Hell,
If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones,
To flaming youth, let Vertue be as waxe,
And melt in her owne fire. Proclaime no shame,
When the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge,
Since Frost it selfe, as actiuely doth burne,
As Reason panders Will.
+QUEENE
O Hamlet, speake no more.
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soule,
And there I see such blacke and grained spots,
As will not leaue their Tinct.
+HAMLET
Nay, but to liue
In the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew'd in Corruption; honying and making loue
Ouer the nasty Stye.
+QUEENE
Oh speake to me, no more,
These words like Daggers enter in mine eares.
No more sweet Hamlet.
+HAMLET
A Murderer, and a Villaine:
A Slaue, that is not twentieth patt the tythe
Of your precedent Lord. A vice of Kings,
A Cutpurse of the Empire and the Rule.
That from a shelfe, the precious Diadem stole,
And put it in his Pocket.
+QUEENE
No more.
+HAMLET
A King of shreds and patches.
SD: Enter Ghost.
Saue me; and houer o're me with your wings
You heauenly Guards. What would you gracious figure?
+QUEENE
Alas he's mad.
+HAMLET
Do you not come your tardy Sonne to chide,
That laps't in Time and Passion, lets go by
Th'important acting of your dread command?
Oh say.
GHOST
Do not forget: this Visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But looke, Amazement on thy Mother sits;
O step betweene her, and her fighting Soule,
Conceit in weakest bodies, strongest workes.
Speake to her Hamlet.
+HAMLET
How is it with you Lady?
+QUEENE
Alas, how is't with you?
That you bend your eye on vacancie,
And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse.
Forth at your eyes, your spirits wildely peepe,
And as the sleeping Soldiours in th'Alarme,
Your bedded haire, like life in excrements,
Start vp, and stand an end. Oh gentle Sonne,
Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle coole patience. Whereon do you looke?
+HAMLET
On him, on him: look you how pale he glares,
His forme and cause conioyn'd, preaching to stones,
Would make them capeable. Do not looke vpon me,
Least with this pitteous action you conuert
My sterne effects: then what I haue to do,
Will want true colour; teares perchance for blood.
+QUEENE
To who do you speake this?
+HAMLET
Do you see nothing there?
+QUEENE
Nothing at all, yet all that is I see.
+HAMLET
Nor did you nothing heare?
+QUEENE
No, nothing but our selues.
+HAMLET
Why look you there: looke how it steals away:
My Father in his habite, as he liued,
Looke where he goes euen now out at the Portall.
SD: +HAMLET exits
+QUEENE
This is the very coynage of your Braine,
This bodilesse Creation extasie
is very cunning in.
+HAMLET
Extasie?
My Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time,
And makes as healthfull Musicke. It is not madnesse
That I haue vttered; bring me to the Test
And I the matter will re-word: which madnesse
Would gamboll from. Mother, for loue of Grace,
Lay not a flattering Vnction to your soule,
That not your trespasse, but my madnesse speakes:
It will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place,
Whil'st ranke Corruption mining all within,
Infects vnseene. Confesse your selfe to Heauen,
Repent what's past, auoyd what is to come,
And do not spred the Compost or the Weedes,
To make them ranke. Forgiue me this my Vertue,
For in the fatnesse of this pursie times,
Vertue it selfe, of Vice must pardon begge,
Yea courb, and woe, for leaue to do him good.
+QUEENE
Oh Hamlet, / Thou hast cleft my heart in twaine.
+HAMLET
O throw away the worser part of it,
And liue the purer with the other halfe.
Good night, but go not to mine Vnkles bed,
Assume a Vertue, if you haue it not,
refraine to night,
And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse
To the next abstinence.
Once more goodnight,
And when you are desirous to be blest,
Ile blessing begge of you. For this same Lord,
I do repent: but heauen hath pleas'd it so,
To punish me with this, and this with me,
That I must be their Scourge and Minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gaue him: so againe, good night.
I must be cruell, onely to be kinde;
Thus bad begins, and worse remaines behinde.
+QUEENE
What shall I do?
+HAMLET
Not this by no meanes that I bid you do:
Let the blunt King tempt you againe to bed,
Pinch Wanton on your cheeke, call you his Mouse,
And let him for a paire of reechie kisses,
Or padling in your necke with his damn'd Fingers,
Make you to rauell all this matter out,
That I essentially am not in madnesse,
But made in craft. 'Twere good you let him know,
For who that's but a Queene, faire, sober, wise,
Would from a Paddocke, from a Bat, a Gibbe,
Such deere concernings hide, Who would do so,
No in despight of Sense and Secrecie,
Vnpegge the Basket on the houses top:
Let the Birds flye, and like the famous Ape
To try Conclusions in the Basket, creepe
And breake your owne necke downe.
+QUEENE
Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
And breath of life: I haue no life to breath
What thou hast saide to me.
+HAMLET
I must to England, you know that?
+QUEENE
Alacke
I had forgot: 'Tis so concluded on.
+HAMLET
This man shall set me packing:
Ile lugge the Guts into the Neighbor roome,
Mother goodnight. Indeede this Counsellor
Is now most still, most secret, and most graue,
Who was in life, a foolish prating Knaue.
Come sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Good night Mother.

NS: Act 4 Scene 1

SD: Enter +KING.
+KING
There's matters in these sighes. / These profound heaues
You must translate; Tis fit we vnderstand them.
Where is your Sonne?
+QUEENE
Ah my good Lord, what haue I seene to night?
+KING
What Gertrude? How do's Hamlet?
+QUEENE
Mad as the Seas, and winde, when both contend
Which is the Mightier, in his lawlesse fit
Behinde the Arras, hearing something stirre,
He whips his Rapier out, and cries a Rat, a Rat,
And in his brainish apprehension killes
The vnseene good old man.
+KING
On heauy deed:
It had bin so with vs had we beene there:
His Liberty is full of threats to all,
To you your selfe, to vs, to euery one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deede be answered?
It will be laide to vs, whose prouidence
Should haue kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt,
This mad yong man. But so much was our loue,
We would not vnderstand what was most fit,
But like the Owner of a foule disease,
To keepe it from divulging, let's it feede
Euen on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
+QUEENE
To draw apart the body he hath kild,
O're whom his very madnesse like some Oare
Among a Minerall of Mettels base
Shewes it selfe pure. He weepes for what is done.
+KING
Oh Gertrude, come away:
The Sun no sooner shall the Mountaines touch,
But we will ship him hence, and this vilde deed,
We must with all our Maiesty and Skill
Both countenance, and excuse. / Ho Guildenstern:
SD: Enter +ROS. & +GUILD.
+KING
Friends both go ioyne you with some further ayde:
Hamlet in madnesse hath Polonius slaine,
And from his Mother Clossets hath he drag'd him.
Go seeke him out, speake faire, and bring the body
Into the Chappell. I pray you hast in this.
SD: Exit Gent.
+KING
Come Gertrude, wee'l call vp our wisest friends,
To let them know both what we meane to do,
And what's vntimely done.
Oh come away,
My soule is full of discord and dismay.
SD: Exuent KING, QUEENE

+HAMLET
What noise? Who cals on Hamlet?
Oh heere they come.
SD: Enter +ROS. and +GUILDENSTERNE.
+ROSINCRANE
What haue you done my Lord with the dead body?
+HAMLET
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis Kinne.
+ROSINCRANE
Tell vs where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
And beare it to the Chappell.
+HAMLET
Do not beleeue it.
+ROSINCRANE
Beleeue what?
+HAMLET
That I can keepe your counsell, and not mine owne.
Besides, to be demanded of a Spundge, what replication
should be made by the Sonne of a King.
+ROSINCRANE
Take you me for a Spundge, my Lord?
+HAMLET
I sir, that sokes vp the Kings Countenance,
his Rewards, his Authorities [but such Officers do the
King best seruice in the end. He keepes them like an Ape
in the corner of his iaw, first mouth'd to be
last swallowed, when he needes what you haue glean'd,
it is but squeezing you, and Spundge you shall be dry
againe.
+ROSINCRANE
I vnderstand you not my Lord.
+HAMLET
I am glad of it: a knauish speech sleepes in a
foolish eare.
+ROSINCRANE
My Lord, you must tell vs where the body
is, and go with vs to the King.
+HAMLET
The body is with the King, but the King is not
with the body. The King, is a thing---
+GUILDENSTERN
A thing my Lord?
+HAMLET
Of nothing: bring me to him, hide Fox, and all
after.
SD: Exuent HAMLET, ROSINCRANE, GUILDENSTERN

NS: Act 4 Scene 3

SD: Enter +KING.
+KING
I haue sent to seeke him, and to find the bodie:
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose:
Yet must not we put the strong Law on him:
Hee's loued of the distracted multitude,
Who like not in their iudgement, but their eyes:
And where 'tis so, th'Offenders scourge is weigh'd
But neerer the offence: to beare all smooth, and euen,
This sodaine sending him away, must seeme
Deliberate pause, diseases desperate growne,
By desperate appliance are releeued,
Or not at all.
SD: Enter +ROSINCRANE.
+KING
How now? What hath befalne?
+ROSINCRANE
Where the dead body is bestow'd my Lord,
We cannot get from him.
+KING
But where is he?
+ROSINCRANE
Without my Lord, guarded to know your pleasure.
+KING
Bring him before vs.
+ROSINCRANE
Hoa, Guildensterne? Bring in my Lord.
SD: Enter +HAMLET and +GUILDENSTERNE.
+KING
Now Hamlet, where's Polonius?
+HAMLET
At Supper.
+KING
At Supper? Where?
+HAMLET
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten, a certaine
conuocation of wormes are e'ne at him. Your
worm is your onely Emperor for diet. We fat all creatures
else to fat vs, and we fat our selfe for Magots. Your
fat King, and your leane Begger is but variable seruice
to dishes, but to one Table that's the end.
+KING
What dost thou meane by this?
+HAMLET
Nothing but to shew you how a King may go a
Progresse through the guts of a Begger.
+KING
Where is Polonius.
+HAMLET
In heauen, send thither to see. If your Messenger
finde him not there, seeke him i'th other place
your selfe: but indeed, if you finde him not this
moneth, you shall nose him as you go vp the staires into
the Lobby.
+KING
Go seeke him there.
+HAMLET
He will stay till ye come.
+KING
Hamlet, this deed of thine, for thine especial safety
Which we do tender, as we deerely greeue
For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence
With fierie Quicknesse. Therefore prepare thy selfe,
The Barke is readie, and the winde at helpe,
Th'Associates tend, and euery thing at bent
For England.
+HAMLET
For England?
+KING
I Hamlet.
+HAMLET
Good.
+KING
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
+HAMLET
I see a Cherube that see's him: but come, for
England. Farewell deere Mother.
+KING
Thy louing Father Hamlet.
+HAMLET
My Mother: Father and Mother is man and wife:
man & wife is one flesh, and so my mother. Come,
for England.
SD: +HAMLET exits
+KING
Follow him at foote, / Tempt him with speed aboord:
Delay it not, Ile haue him hence to night.
Away, for euery thing is Seal'd and done
That else leanes on th'Affaire, pray you make hast.
And England, if my loue thou holdst at ought,
As my great power thereof may giue thee sense,
Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red
After the Danish Sword, and thy free awe
Payes homage to vs; thou maist not coldly set
Our Soueraigne Processe, which imports at full
By Letters coniuring to that effect
The present death of Hamlet. Do it England,
For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages,
And thou must cure me: Till I know 'tis done,
How ere my happes, my ioyes were ne're begun.

+FORTINBRAS
Go Captaine, from me greet the Danish King,
Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras
Claimes the conueyance of a promis'd March
Ouer his Kingdome. You know the Rendeuous:
If that his Maiesty would ought with vs,
We shall expresse our dutie in his eye,
And let him know so.

I will doo't, my Lord.

NS: Act 4 Scene 5

SD: Enter +QUEENE and +HORATIO.
+QUEENE
I will not speake with her.

+HORATIO
She is importunate, indeed distract,
her moode will needs be pittied.

+QUEENE
What would she haue?

+HORATIO
She speakes much of her Father; saies she heares
There's trickes i'th'world, and hems, and beats her heart,
Spurnes enuiously at Strawes, speakes things in doubt,
That carry but halfe sense: Her speech is nothing,
Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth moue
The hearers to Collection; they ayme at it,
And botch the words vp fit to their owne thoughts,
Which as her winkes, and nods, and gestures yeeld them,
Indeed would make one thinke there would be thought,
Though nothing sure, yet much vnhappily.

+QUEENE
'Twere good she were spoken with, / For she may strew
dangerous coniectures / In ill breeding minds.
Let her come in.
To my sicke soule [as sinnes true Nature is]
Each toy seemes Prologue, to some great amisse,
So full of Artlesse iealousie is guilt,
It spill's it selfe, in fearing to be spilt.
SD: Enter +OPHELIA distracted.
+OPHELIA
Where is the beauteous Maiesty of Denmark.

+QUEENE
How now Ophelia?

+OPHELIA
How should I your true loue know
from another one?
By his Cockle hat and staffe,
and his Sandal shoone.

+QUEENE
Alas sweet Lady: what imports this Song?

+OPHELIA
Say you? Nay pray you marke.
He is dead and gone Lady,
he is dead and gone,
At his head a grasse-greene Turfe,
at his heeles a stone.

+QUEENE
Nay but Ophelia.

+OPHELIA
Pray you marke.
White his Shrow'd as the Mountaine Snow.
SD: Enter +KING.
+QUEENE
Alas, looke heere my Lord.

+OPHELIA
Larded with sweet flowers:
Which bewept to the graue did not go,
With true-loue showres.

+KING
How do ye, pretty Lady?

+OPHELIA
Well, God dil'd you. They say the Owle was a
Bakers daughter. Lord, wee know what we are, but know
not what we may be. God be at your Table.

+KING
Conceit vpon her Father.

+OPHELIA
Pray you let's haue no words of this: but when they
aske you what it meanes, say you this:
To morrow is S. Valentines day,
all in the morning betime,
And I a Maid at your Window,
to be your Valentine.
Then vp he rose, & don'd his clothes,
& dupt the chamber dore,
Let in the Maid, that out a Maid,
neuer departed more.

+KING
Pretty Ophelia.

+OPHELIA
Indeed la? without an oath Ile make an end
ont.
By gis, and by S. Charity,
Alacke, and fie for shame:
Yong men wil doo't, if they come too't,
By Cocke they are too blame.
Quoth she before you tumbled me,
You promis'd me to Wed:
So would I ha done by yonder Sunne,
And thou hadst not come to my bed.

+KING
How long hath she bin this?

+OPHELIA
I hope all will be well. We must bee patient, but
I cannot choose but weepe, to thinke they should lay him
i'th'cold ground: My brother shall knowe of it, and so I
thanke you for your good counsell. Come, my Coach:
Goodnight Ladies: Goodnight sweet Ladies: Goodnight,
goodnight.
SD: +OPHELIA exits
+KING
Follow her close, / Giue her good watch I pray you:
Oh this is the poyson of deepe greefe, it springs
All from her Fathers death.
Oh Gertrude, Gertrude,
When sorrowes comes, they come not single spies,
But in Battaliaes. First, her Father slaine,
Next your Sonne gone, and he most violent Author
Of his owne iust remoue: the people muddied,
Thicke and vnwholsome in their thoughts, and whispers
For good POLONIUS death; and we haue done but greenly
In hugger mugger to interre him. Poore OPHELIA
Diuided from her selfe, and her faire Iudgement,
Without the which we are Pictures, or meere Beasts.
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Her Brother is in secret come from France,
Keepes on his wonder, keepes himselfe in clouds,
And wants not Buzzers to infect his eare
With pestilent Speeches of his Fathers death,
Where in necessitie of matter Beggard,
Will nothing sticke our persons to Arraigne
In eare and eare. O my deere Gertrude, this,
Like to a murdering Peece in many places,
Giues me superfluous death.
SD: A Noise within.
+QUEENE
Alacke, what noyse is this?

+KING
Where are my Switzers? / Let them guard the doore.
SD: Enter a Messenger.
What is the matter?

+MESSENGER
Saue your selfe, my Lord.
The Ocean [ouer-peering of his List]
Eates not the Flats with more impittious haste
Then young LAERTES, in a Riotous head,
Ore-beares your Officers, the rabble call him Lord,
And as the world were now but to begin,
Antiquity forgot, Custome not knowne,
The Ratifiers and props of euery word,
They cry choose we? Laertes shall be King,
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds,
Laertes shall be King, Laertes King.
SD: Noise within.

How cheerefully on the false Traile they cry,
Oh this is Counter you false Danish Dogges.

Where is the King, sirs? Stand you all without.

No, let's come in.

I pray you giue me leaue.

+KING, +QUEENE, +HORATIO, +LAERTES, +MESSENGER
We will, we will.

+LAERTES
I thanke you: Keepe the doore.
Oh thou vilde King,
giue me my Father.

+QUEENE
Calmely good Laertes.

+LAERTES
That drop of blood, that calmes / Proclaimes me Bastard:
Cries Cuckold to my Father, brands the Harlot
Euen heere betweene the chaste vnsmirched brow
Of my true Mother.

+KING
What is the cause Laertes,
That thy Rebellion lookes so Gyant-like?
Let him go Gertrude: Do not feare our person:
There's such Diuinity doth hedge a King,
That Treason can but peepe to what it would,
Acts little of his will. Tell me Laertes,
Why thou art thus Incenst? Let him go Gertrude.
Speake man.

+LAERTES
Where's my Father?

+KING
Dead.

+QUEENE
But not by him.

+KING
Let him demand his fill.

+LAERTES
How came he dead? Ile not be Iuggel'd with.
To hell Allegeance: Vowes, to the blackest diuell.
Conscience and Grace, to the profoundest Pit.
I dare Damnation: to this point I stand,
That both the worlds I giue to negligence,
Let come what comes: onely Ile be reueng'd
Most throughly for my Father.

+KING
Who shall stay you?

+LAERTES
My Will, not all the world,
And for my meanes, Ile husband them so well,
They shall go farre with little.

+KING
Good Laertes:
If you desire to know the certaintie
Of your deere Fathers death, if writ in your reuenge,
That Soop-stake you will draw both Friend and Foe,
Winner and Looser.

+LAERTES
None but his Enemies.

+KING
Will you know them then.

+LAERTES
To his good Friends, thus wide Ile ope my Armes:
And like the kinde Life-rend'ring Politician,
Repast them with my blood.

+KING
Why now you speake
Like a good Childe, and a true Gentleman.
That I am guiltlesse of your Fathers death,
And am most sensible in greefe for it,
It shall as leuell to your Iudgement pierce
As day do's to your eye.
SD: A noise within.
Let her come in.

How now? what noise is that?
SD: Enter +Ophelia.
Oh heate drie vp my Braines, teares seuen times salt,
Burne out the Sence and Vertue of mine eye.
By Heauen, thy madnesse shall be payed by waight,
Till our Scale turnes the beame. Oh Rose of May,
Deere Maid, kinde Sister, sweet Ophelia:
Oh Heauens, is't possible, a yong Maids wits,
Should be as mortall as an old mans life?
Nature is fine in Loue, and where 'tis fine,
It sends some precious instance of it selfe
After the thing it loues.

+OPHELIA
They bore him bare fac'd on the Beer,
Hey non nony, nony, hey nony:
And on his graue raines many a teare,
Fare you well my Doue.

+LAERTES
Had'st thou thy wits, and did'st perswade Reuenge,
it could not moue thus.

+OPHELIA
You must sing downe a-downe, and you call
him a-downe-a. Oh, how the wheele becomes it? It is the
false Steward that stole his masters daughter.

+LAERTES
This nothings more then matter.

+OPHELIA
There's Rosemary, that's for Remembraunce.
Pray loue remember: and there is Paconcies, that's
for Thoughts.

+LAERTES
A document in madnesse, thoughts &
remembrance fitted.

+OPHELIA
There's Fennell for you, and Columbines: ther's
Rew for you, and heere's some for me. Wee may call it
Herbe-Grace a Sundaies: Oh you must weare your Rew
with a difference. There's a Daysie, I would giue you some
Violets, but they wither'd all when my Father dyed: They
say, he made a good end;
For bonny sweet Robin is all my ioy.

+LAERTES
Thought, and Affliction, Passion, Hell it selfe:
She turnes to Fauour, and to prettinesse.

+OPHELIA
And will he not come againe,
And will he not come againe:
No, no, he is dead,
go to thy Death-bed,
He neuer wil come againe.
His Beard as white as Snow,
All Flaxen was his Pole:
He is gone, he is gone,
and we cast away mone,
Gramercy on his Soule.
And of all Christian Soules, I pray God. God buy ye.
SD: +OPHELIA exits
+LAERTES
Do you see this, you Gods?

+KING
Laertes, I must common with your greefe,
Or you deny me right: go but apart,
Make choice of whom your wisest Friends you will,
And they shall heare and iudge 'twixt you and me;
If by direct or by Colaterall hand
They finde vs touch'd, we will our Kingdome giue,
Our Crowne, our Life, and all that we call Ours
To you in satisfaction. But if not,
Be you content to lend your patience to vs,
And we shall ioyntly labour with your soule
To giue it due content.

+LAERTES
Let this be so:
His meanes of death, his obscure buriall;
No Trophee, Sword, nor Hatchment o're his bones,
No Noble rite, nor formall ostentation,
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from Heauen to Earth,
That I must call in question.

+KING
So you shall:
And where th'offence is, let the great Axe fall.
I pray you go with me.

SD: Enter +HORATIO, with an Attendant.
+HORATIO
What are they that would speake with me?

+ATTENDANT
Saylors sir, they say they haue
Letters for you.

+HORATIO
Let them come in,
I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
SD: Enter Saylor.
+SAYLOR
God blesse you Sir.

+HORATIO
Let him blesse thee too.

+SAYLOR
Hee shall Sir, and't please him. There's a Letter for
you Sir: It comes from th' Ambassadours that was bound
for England, if your name be Horatio, as I am let to
know it is.
SD: +HORATIO Reads the Letter.
HOratio, When thou shalt haue
ouerlook'd this, giue these Fellowes some meanes to the King:
They haue Letters for him. Ere we were two dayes old at Sea,
a Pyrate of very Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace. Finding
our selues tooslow of Saile, we put on a compelled Valour.
In the Grapple, I boorded them: On the instant they got
cleare of our Shippe, so I alone became their Prisoner. They
haue dealt with mee, likeTheeues of Mercy, but they knew
what they did. I am to doea good turne for them. Let the
King haue the Letters I hauesent, and repaire thou to me
with as much hast as thou wouldestflye death. I haue words
to speake in your eare, will make thee dumbe, yet are they
much too light for the bore of the Matter. These good Fellowes
will bring thee where I am. Rosincrance and Guildensterne,
hold their course for England. Of them I haue much
to tell thee, Farewell.
He that thou knowest thine,
Hamlet.

+HORATIO
Come, I will giue you way for these your Letters,
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
To him from whom you brought them.

NS: Act 4, scene 7
SD: Enter +KING and +LAERTES.
+KING
Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
And you must put me in your heart for Friend,
Sith you haue heard, and with a knowing eare,
That he which hath your Noble Father slaine,
Pursued my life.

+LAERTES
It well appeares. But tell me,
Why you proceeded not against these feates,
So crimefull, and so Capitall in Nature,
As by your Safety, Wisedome, all things else,
You mainly were stirr'd vp?

+KING
O for two speciall Reasons,
Which may to you [perhaps] seeme much vnsinnowed,
And yet to me they are strong. The Queen his Mother,
Liues almost by his lookes: and for my selfe,
My Vertue or my Plague, be it either which,
She's so coniunctiue to my life and soule;
That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere,
I could not but by her. The other Motiue,
Why to a publike count I might not go,
Is the great loue the generall gender beare him,
Who dipping all his Faults in their affection,
Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone,
Conuert his Gyues to Graces. So that my Arrowes
Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde,
Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe,
And not where I had arm'd them.

+LAERTES
And so haue I a Noble Father lost,
A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes,
Who was [if praises may go backe againe]
Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age
For her perfections. But my reuenge will come.

+KING
Breake not your sleepes for that, / You must not thinke
That we are made of stuffe, so flat, and dull,
That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger,
And thinke it pastime. You shortly shall heare more,
I lou'd your Father, and we loue our Selfe,
And that I hope will teach you to imagine---
SD: Enter a Messenger.
How now? What Newes?

+MESSENGER
Letters my Lord from Hamlet.
This to your Maiesty: this to the Queene.

+KING
From Hamlet? Who brought them?

+MESSENGER
Saylors my Lord they say, I saw them not:
They were giuen me by +CLAUDIO, he receiu'd them.

+KING
Laertes you shall heare them:
Leaue vs.
SD: +MESSENGER exits
High and Mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your
Kingdome. To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly
Eyes. When I shall [first asking your Pardon thereunto]
recount th'Occasions of my sodaine, and more strange returne.
Hamlet.
What should this meane? Are all the rest come backe?
Or is it some abuse? Or no such thing?

+LAERTES
Know you the hand?

+KING
'Tis Hamlets Character, naked
and in a Post- script here he sayes alone:
Can you aduise me?

+LAERTES
I'm lost in it my Lord; but let him come,
It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart,
That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth;
Thus diddest thou.

+KING
If it be so Laertes,
as how should it be so: / How otherwise
will you be rul'd by me?

+LAERTES
If so you'l not o'rerule me to a peace.

+KING
To thine owne peace: if he be now return'd,
As checking at his Voyage, and that he meanes
No more to vndertake it; I will worke him
To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice,
Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall;
And for his death no winde of blame shall breath,
But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice,
And call it accident:
Some two Monthes hence
Here was a Gentleman of Normandy,
I'ue seene my selfe, and seru'd against the French,
And they ran well on Horsebacke; but this Gallant
Had witchcraft in't; he grew into his Seat,
And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse,
As had he beene encorps't and demy-Natur'd
With the braue Beast, so farre he past my thought,
That I in forgery of shapes and trickes,
Come short of what he did.

+LAERTES
A Norman was't?

+KING
A Norman.

+LAERTES
Vpon my life Lamound.

+KING
The very same.

+LAERTES
I know him well, he is the Brooch indeed,
And Iemme of all our Nation.

+KING
Hee mad confession of you,
And gaue you such a Masterly report,
For Art and exercise in your defence;
And for your Rapier most especially,
That he cryed out, t'would be a sight indeed,
If one could match you
Sir. This report of his
Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy,
That he could nothing doe but wish and begge,
Your sodaine comming ore to play with him;
Now out of this.

+LAERTES
Why out of this, my Lord?

+KING
Laertes was your Father deare to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart?

+LAERTES
Why aske you this?

+KING
Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father,
But that I know Loue is begun by Time:
And that I see in passages of proofe,
Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it:
Hamlet comes backe: what would you vndertake,
To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed,
More then in words?

+LAERTES
To cut his throat i'th' Church.

+KING
No place indeed should murder Sancturize;
Reuenge should haue no bounds: but good Laertes
Will you doe this, keepe close within your Chamber,
Hamlet return'd, shall know you are come home:
Wee'l put on those shall praise your excellence,
And set a double varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gaue you, bring you in fine together,
And wager on your heads, he being remisse,
Most generous, and free from all contriuing,
Will not peruse the Foiles? So that with ease,
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
A Sword vnbaited, and in a passe of practice,
Requit him for your Father.

+LAERTES
I will doo't,
And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword:
I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke
So mortall, I but dipt a knife in it,
Where it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare,
Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue
Vnder the Moone, can saue the thing from death,
That is but scratcht withall: Ile touch my point,
With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,
It may be death.

+KING
Let's further thinke of this,
Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes
May fit vs to our shape, if this should faile;
And that our drift looke through our bad performance,
'Twere better not assaid; therefore this Proiect
Should haue a backe or second, that might hold,
If this should blast in proofe: Soft, let me see
Wee'l make a solemne wager on your commings,
I ha't:
when in your motion you are hot and dry,
As make your bowts more violent to the end,
And that he cals for drinke; Ile haue prepar'd him
A Challice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
Our purpose may hold there;

One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele,
So fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd Laertes.

+LAERTES
Drown'd! O where?

+QUEEN
There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke,
That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame:
There with fantasticke Garlands did she come,
Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples,
That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name;
But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them:
There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds
Clambring to hang; an enuious sliuer broke,
When downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe,
Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide,
And Mermaid-like, a while they bore her vp,
Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
As one incapable of her owne distresse,
Or like a creature Natiue, and indued
Vnto that Element: but long it could not be,
Till that her garments, heauy with her drinke,
Pul'd the poore wretch from her melodious buy,
To muddy death.

+LAERTES
Alas then, is she drown'd?

+QUEEN
Drown'd, drown'd.

+LAERTES
Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia,
And therefore I forbid my teares: but yet
It is our tricke, Nature her custome holds,
Let shame say what it will; when these are gone
The woman will be out: Adue my Lord,
I haue a speech of fire, that faine would blaze,
But that this folly doubts it.

NS: Act 5, Scene 1

SD: Enter two Clownes.

+CLOWN
Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall,
that wilfully seekes her owne saluation?
+OTHER
I tell thee she is, and therefore make her
Graue straight, the Crowner hath sate on her, and finds
it Christian buriall.
+CLOWN
How can that be, vnlesse she drowned
her selfe in her owne defence?
+OTHER
Why 'tis found so.
+CLOWN
It must be Se offendendo, it cannot bee else:
for heere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe wittingly, it
argues an Act: and an Act hath three branches. It is an
Act to doe and to performe; argall she drown'd her selfe
wittingly.
+OTHER
Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer.
+CLOWN
Giue me leaue; heere lies the water; good:
heere stands the man; good: If the man goe to this water
and drowne himsele; it is will he nill he, he goes; marke
you that? But if the water come to him & drowne him;
hee drownes not himselfe. Argall, hee that is not guilty of
his owne death, shortens not his owne life.
+OTHER
But is this law?
+CLOWN
I marry is't, Crowners Quest Law.
+OTHER
Will you ha the truth on't: if this had
not beene a Gentlewoman, shee should haue beene buried
out of Christian Buriall.
+CLOWN
Why there thou say'st. And the more pitty
that great folke should haue countenance in this world to
drowne or hang themselues, more then their euen Christian.
Come, my Spade; there is no ancient Gentlemen,
but Gardiners, Ditchers and Graue-makers; they
hold vp Adams Profession.
+OTHER
Was he a Gentleman?
+CLOWN
He was the first that euer bore Armes.
+OTHER
Why he had none.
+CLOWN
What, ar't a Heathen? how dost thou
vnderstand the Scripture? the Scripture sayes Adam
dig'd; could hee digge without Armes? Ile put another
question to thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose,
confesse thy selfe---
+OTHER
Go too.
+CLOWN
What is he that builds stronger then
either the Mason, the Shipwright, or the Carpenter?
+OTHER
The Gallowes maker; for that Frame
outliues a thousand Tenants.
+CLOWN
I like thy wit well in good faith, the
Gallowes does well; but how does it well? it does well to
those that doe ill: now, thou dost ill to say the Gallowes is
built stronger then the Church: Argall, the Gallowes may
doe well to thee. Too't againe, Come.
+OTHER
Who builds stronger then a Mason, a
Shipwright, or a Carpenter?
+CLOWN
I, tell me that, and vnyoake.
+OTHER
Marry, now I can tell.
+CLOWN
Too't.
+OTHER
Masse, I cannot tell.

the Houses that he makes, lasts till Doomesday: go,
get thee to Yaughan, fetch me a stoupe of Liquor.

Sings.
In youth when I did loue, did loue,
me thought it was very sweete:
To contract O the time for a my behoue,
O me thought there was nothing meete.
+HAMLET
Ha's this fellow no feeling of his businesse, that he
sings at Graue-making?
+HORATIO
Custome hath made it in him a property of
easinesse.
+HAMLET
'Tis ee'n so; the hand of little Imployment
hath the daintier sense.
+CLOWN
sings.
But Age with his stealing steps
hath caught me in his clutch:
And hath shipped me intill the Land,
as if I had neuer beene such.
+HAMLET
That Scull had a tongue in it, and could sing
once: how the knaue iowles it to the grownd, as if it were
Caines Iaw-bone, that did the first murther: It might be
the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o're Offices:
one that could circumuent God, might it not?
+HORATIO
It might, my Lord.
+HAMLET
Or of a Courtier, which could say, Good Morrow
sweet Lord: how dost thou, good Lord? this
might be my Lord such a one, that prais'd my Lord
such a ones Horse, when he meant to begge it; might it
not?
+HORATIO
I, my Lord.
+HAMLET
Why ee'n so: and now my Lady Wormes, Chaplesse,
and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons
Spade; heere's fine Reuolution, if wee had the tricke to

to play at Loggets with 'em? mine ake to thinke on't.

A Pickhaxe and a Spade, a Spade,
for and a shrowding-Sheete:
O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
for such a Guest is meete.
+HAMLET
There's another: why might not that bee the Scull
of a Lawyer? where be his Quiddits now? his Quillets?
his Cases? his Tenures, and his Tricks? why doe's he
suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about the
Sconce with a dirty Shouell, and will not tell him of his
Action of Battery? hum. This fellow might be in's
time a great buyer of Land, with his Statutes, his Recognizances,
his Fines, his double Vouchers, his Recoueries:
Is this the fine of his Fines, and the recouery of his
Recoueries, to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt? will
his Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases, and
double ones too, then the length and breadth of a paire
of Indentures? the very Conueyances of his Lands will
hardly lye in this Boxe; and must the Inheritor himselfe
haue no more? ha?
+HORATIO
Not a iot more, my Lord.
+HAMLET
Is not Parchment made of Sheep-skinnes?
+HORATIO
I my Lord, and of Calue-skinnes too.
+HAMLET
They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance
in that. I will speake to this fellow: whose
Graue's this Sir?
+CLOWN
Mine Sir:

O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
for such a Guest is meete.
+HAMLET
I thinke it be thine indeed: for thou liest in't.
+CLOWN
You lye out on't Sir, and therefore it is
not yours: for my part, I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine.
+HAMLET
Thou dost lye in't, to be in't and say 'tis thine:
'tis for the dead, not for the quicke, therefore thou
lyest.
+CLOWN
'Tis a quicke lye Sir, 'twill away againe
from me to you.
+HAMLET
What man dost thou digge it for?
+CLOWN
For no man Sir.
+HAMLET
What woman then?
+CLOWN
For none neither.
+HAMLET
Who is to be buried in't?
+CLOWN
One that was a woman Sir; but rest her
Soule, shee's dead.
+HAMLET
How absolute the knaue is? wee must speake by
the Carde, or equiuocation will vndoe vs: by the Lord
Horatio, these three yeares I haue taken note of it, the Age
is growne so picked, that the toe of the Pesant comes so
neere the heeles of our Courtier, hee galls his Kibe. How
long hast thou been a Graue-maker?
+CLOWN
Of all the dayes i'th' yeare, I came too't that
day that our last King Hamlet o'recame Fortinbras.
+HAMLET
How long is that since?
+CLOWN
Cannot you tell that? euery foole can tell
that: It was the very day, that young Hamlet was borne,
hee that was mad, and sent into England.
+HAMLET
I marry, why was he sent into England?
+CLOWN
Why, because he was mad; hee shall recouer
his wits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter
there.
+HAMLET
Why?
+CLOWN
'Twill not be seene in him, there
the men are as mad as he.
+HAMLET
How came he mad?
+CLOWN
Very strangely they say.
+HAMLET
How strangely?
+CLOWN
Faith e'ene with loosing his wits.
+HAMLET
Vpon what ground?
+CLOWN
Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin
sixeteene heere, man and Boy thirty yeares.
+HAMLET
How long will a man lie 'ith' earth ere he rot?
+CLOWN
Ifaith, if he be not rotten before he die [as
we haue many pocky Coarses now adaies, that will scarce
hold the laying in] he will last you some eight yeare, or
nine yeare. A Tanner will last you nine yeare.
+HAMLET
Why he, more then another?
+CLOWN
Why sir, his hide is so tan'd with his
Trade, that he will keepe out water a great while. And your
water, is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body.
Heres a Scull now: this Scul, has laine in the earth three & twenty
years.
+HAMLET
Whose was it?
+CLOWN
A whoreson mad Fellowes it was; / Whose
doe you thinke it was?
+HAMLET
Nay, I know not.
+CLOWN
A pestlence on him for a mad Rogue,
a pou'rd a Flaggon of Renish on my head once. This
same Scull Sir, this same Scull sir, was Yoricks Scull, the Kings Iester.
+HAMLET
This?
+CLOWN
E'ene that.
+HAMLET
Let me see. Alas poore Yorick, I knew him
Horatio, a fellow of infinite Iest; of most excellent fancy,
he hath borne me on his backe a thousand times: And
how abhorred my Imagination is, my gorge
rises at it. Heere hung those lipps, that I haue kist I
know not how oft. Where be your Iibes now? Your
Gambals? Your Songs? Your flashes of Merriment that
were wont to set the Table on a Rore? No one now to
mock your own Ieering? Quite chopfalne? Now get
you to my Ladies Chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch
thicke, to this fauour she must come. Make her laugh at
that: prythee Horatio tell me one thing.
+HORATIO
What's that my Lord?
+HAMLET
Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o'this fashion
i'th' earth?
+HORATIO
E'ene so.
+HAMLET
And smelt so? Puh.
+HORATIO
E'ene so, my Lord.
+HAMLET
To what base vses we may returne Horatio. Why
may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander,
till he find it stopping a bunghole.
+HORATIO
'Twere to consider: to curiously to consider so.
+HAMLET
No faith, not a iot. But to follow him thether
with modestie enough, & likeliehood to lead it; as thus.
Alexander died: Alexander was buried: Alexander
returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make
Lome, and why of that Lome [whereto he was conuerted]
might they not stopp a Beere-barrell?
Imperiall Casar, dead and turn'd to clay,
Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away.
Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
Should patch a Wall, t'expell the winters flaw.
But soft, but soft, aside;
SD: Enter +KING, +QUEENE, +LAERTES, and a Coffin, with Lords attendant.
+HAMLET
heere comes the King.
The Queene, the Courtiers. Who is that they follow,
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken,
The Coarse they follow, did with disperate hand,
Fore do it owne life; 'twas some Estate.
Couch we a while, and mark.
+LAERTES
What Cerimony else?
+HAMLET
That is Laertes, a very Noble youth: Marke.
+LAERTES
What Cerimony else?
+PRIEST
Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg'd.
As we haue warrantis, her death was doubtfull,
And but that great Command, o're-swaies the order,
She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg'd,
Till the last Trumpet. For charitable praier,
Shardes, Flints, and Peebles, should be throwne on her:
Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites,
Her Maiden strewments, and the bringing home
Of Bell and Buriall.
+LAERTES
Must there no more be done?
+PRIEST
No more be done:
We should prophane the seruice of the dead,
To sing sage Requiem, and such rest to her
As to peace-parted Soules.
+LAERTES
Lay her i'th' earth,
And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh,
May Violets spring. I tell thee [churlish Priest]
A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be,
When thou liest howling?
+HAMLET
What, the faire Ophelia?
+QUEEN
Sweets, to the sweet farewell.
I hop'd thou should'st haue bin my Hamlets wife:
I thought thy Bride-bed to haue deckt [sweet Maid]
And not t'haue strew'd thy Graue.
+LAERTES
Oh terrible woer,
Fall ten times trebble, on that cursed head
Whose wicked deed, thy most Ingenious sence
Depriu'd thee of.
SD: Leaps in the graue.
+LAERTES
Hold off the earth a while,
Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes:
Now pile your dust, vpon the quicke, and dead,
Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made,
To o're top old Pelion, or the skyish head
Of blew Olympus.
+HAMLET
What is he, whose griefes
Beares such an Emphasis? whose phrase of Sorrow
Coniure the wandring Starres, and makes them stand
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
Hamlet the Dane.
+LAERTES
The deuill take thy soule.
+HAMLET
Thou prai'st not well,
I prythee take thy fingers from my throat;
Sir though I am not Spleenatiue, and rash,
Yet haue I something in me dangerous,
Which let thy wisenesse feare. Away thy hand.
+KING
Pluck them asunder.
+QUEEN
Hamlet, Hamlet.
+GEN
Good my Lord be quiet.
+HAMLET
Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme.
Vntill my eielids will no longer wag.
+QUEEN
Oh my Sonne, what Theame?
+HAMLET
I lou'd Ophelia; fortie thousand Brothers
Could not [with all there quantitie of Loue]
Make vp my summe. What wilt thou do for her?
+KING
Oh he is mad Laertes,
+QUEEN
For loue of God forbeare him.
+HAMLET
Come show me what thou'lt doe.
Woo't weepe? Woo't fight? Woo't teare thy selfe?
Woo't drinke vp Esile, eate a Crocodile?
Ile doo't. Dost thou come heere to whine;
To outface me with leaping in her Graue?
Be buried quicke with her, and so will I.
And if thou prate of Mountaines; let them throw
Millions of Akers on vs; till our ground
Sindging his pate against the burning Zone,
Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, and thoul't mouth,
Ile rant as well as thou.
+KING
This is meere Madnesse:
And thus awhile the fit will worke on him:
Anon as patient as the female Doue,
When that her golden Cuplet are disclos'd;
His silence will sit drooping.
+HAMLET
Heare you Sir:
What is the reason that you vse me thus?
I loud' you euer; but it is no matter:
Let Hercules himselfe doe what he may,
The Cat will Mew, and Dogge will haue his day.
+KING
I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him,
SD: +KING exits
+KING
Strengthen you patience in our last nights speech,
Wee'l put the matter to the present push:
Good Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne,
This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument:
An houre of quiet shortly shall we see;
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
SD: Exeunt +QUEEN, +LAERTES, +HAMLET, +HORATIO




NS: Act 5, Scene 2

SD: Enter +HAMLET and +HORATIO.

+HAMLET
So much for this Sir; now let me see the other,
You doe remember all the Circumstance.

+HORATIO
Remember it my Lord?

+HAMLET
Sir, in my heart there was a kinde of fighting,
That would not let me sleepe; me thought I lay
Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes, rashly,
[And praise be rashnesse for it] let vs know,
Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well,
When our deare plots do paule, and that should teach vs,
There's a Diuinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will.

+HORATIO
That is most certaine.

+HAMLET
Vp from my Cabin
My sea-gowne scarft about me in the darke,
Grop'd I to finde out them; had my desire,
Finger'd their Packet, and in fine, withdrew
To mine owne roome againe, making so bold,
[My feares forgetting manners] to vnseale
Their grand Commission, where I found Horatio,
Oh royall knauery: An exact command,
Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason;
Importing Denmarks health, and Englands too,
With hoo, such Bugges and Goblins in my life,
That on the superuize no leasure bated,
No not to stay the grinding of the Axe,
My head shoud be struck off.

+HORATIO
Ist possible?

+HAMLET
Here's the Commission, read it at more leysure:
But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed?

+HORATIO
I beseech you.

+HAMLET
Being thus benetted round with Villaines,
Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines,
They had begun the Play. I sate me downe,
Deuis'd a new Commission, wrote it faire,
I once did hold it as our Statists doe,
A basenesse to write faire; and laboured much
How to forget that learning: but Sir now,
It did me Yeomans seruice: wilt thou know
The effects of what I wrote?

+HORATIO
I, good my Lord.

+HAMLET
An earnest Coniuration from the King,
As England was his faithfull Tributary,
As loue betweene them, as the Palme should flourish,
As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare,
And stand a Comma 'tweene their amities,
And many such like Assis of great charge,
That on the view and know of these Contents,
Without debatement further, more or lesse,
He should the bearers put to sodaine death,
Not shriuing time allowed.

+HORATIO
How was this seal'd?

+HAMLET
Why, euen in that was Heauen ordinate;
I had my fathers Signet in my Purse,
Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale:
Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other,
Subscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it safely,
The changeling neuer knowne: Now, the next day
Was our Sea Fight, and what to this was sement,
Thou know'st already.

+HORATIO
So Guildensterne and Rosincrance, go too't.

+HAMLET
Why man, they did make loue to this imployment
They are not neere my Conscience; their debate
Doth by their owne insinuation grow:
'Tis dangerous, when the baser nature comes
Betweene the passe, and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites.

+HORATIO
Why, what a King is this?

+HAMLET
Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon
He that bath kil'd my King, and whor'd my Mother,
Popt in betweene th'election and my hopes,
Throwne out his Angle for my proper life,
And with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience,
To quit him with this arme? And is't not to be damn'd
To let this Canker of our nature come
In further euill.

+HORATIO
It must be shortly knowne to him from England
What is the issue of the businesse there.

+HAMLET
It will be short, / The interim's mine,
and a mans life's no more / Then to say one:
but I am very sorry good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot my selfe;
For by the image of my Cause, I see
The Portraiture of his; Ile count his fauours:
But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me
Into a Towring passion.

+HORATIO
Peace, who comes heere?

SD: Enter young +OSR.

+OSR
Your Lordship is right welcome back to Den-marke.

+HAMLET
I humbly thank you Sir, dost
know this waterflie?

+HORATIO
No my good Lord.

+HAMLET
Thy state is the more gracious;
for 'tis a vice to know him: he hath much Land, and
fertile; let a Beast be Lord of Beasts, and his Crib shall
stand at the Kings Messe; 'tis a Chowgh; but as I saw
spacious in the possession of dirt.

+OSR
Sweet Lord, if your friendship were at leysure, I
should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty.

+HAMLET
I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit;
put your Bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head.

+OSR
I thanke your Lordship, 'tis very hot.

+HAMLET
No, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde is
Northerly.

+OSR
It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed.

+HAMLET
Mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my
Complexion.

+OSR
Exceedingly, my Lord, it is very soultry, as 'twere
I cannot tell how: but my Lord, his Maiesty bad me
signifie to you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head:
Sir, this is the matter.

+HAMLET
I beseech you remember.

+OSR
Nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:
Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes
is
at his weapon.

+HAMLET
What's his weapon?

+OSR
Rapier and dagger.

+HAMLET
That's two of his weapons; but well.

+OSR
The sir King ha's wag'd with him six Barbary
Horses, against the which he impon'd as I take it,
sixe French Rapiers and Poniards, with their assignes, as
Girdle, Hangers or so: three of the Carriages infaith
are very deare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most
delicate carriages, and of very liberall conceit.

+HAMLET
What call you the Carriages?

+OSR
The Carriages Sir, are the hangers.

+HAMLET
The phrase would bee more Germaine to the
matter: If we could carry Cannon by our sides; I would
it might be Hangers till then; but on sixe Barbary
Horses against sixe French Swords: their Assignes, and
three liberall conceited Carriages, that's the French but
against the Danish; why is this impon'd as you
call it?

+OSR
The King Sir, hath laid that in a dozen
passes betweene you and him, hee shall not exceed you
three hits; He hath one twelue for mine, and that would
come to imediate tryall, if your Lordship would vouchsafe
the Answere.

+HAMLET
How if I answere no?

+OSR
I meane my Lord, the opposition of your person
in tryall.

+HAMLET
Sir, I will walke heere in the Hall; if it please his
Maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let the
Foyles bee brought, the Gentleman willing, and the King
hold his purpose; I will win for him if I can: if not, Ile
gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits.

+OSR
Shall I redeliuer you ee'n so?

+HAMLET
To this effect Sir, after what flourish your
nature will.

+OSR
I commend my duty to your Lordship.

+HAMLET
Yours, yours;
hee does well to commend it himselfe, there are no
tongues else for's tongue.

+HORATIO
This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his
head.

+HAMLET
He did Complie with his Dugge before hee suck't
it: thus had he and mine more of the same Beauy that I
know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of the
time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of yesty
collection, which carries them through & through the
most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow
them to their tryalls: the Bubbles are out.

+HORATIO
You will lose this wager, my Lord.

+HAMLET
I doe not thinke so, since he went into France, I
haue beene in continuall practice; I shall winne at the oddes:
but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about my
heart: but it is no matter.

+HORATIO
Nay, good my Lord.

+HAMLET
It is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of gain-giuing
as would perhaps trouble a woman.

+HORATIO
If your minde dislike any thing, obey. I will
forestall their repaire hither, and say you are not fit.

+HAMLET
Not a whit, we defie Augury; there's a speciall
Prouidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not
to come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if it be not
now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since no man
ha's ought of what he leaues. What is't to leaue betimes?

SD: Enter +KING, +QUEENE, +LAERTES and Lords, with other Attendants with Foyles, and Gauntlets, a Table and Flagons of Wine on it.

+KING
Come Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.

+HAMLET
Giue me your pardon Sir, I'ue done you wrong,
But pardon't as you are a Gentleman.
This presence knowes, / And you must needs haue heard
how I am punisht / With sore distraction?
What I haue done / That might your nature honour, and exception
Roughly awake, I heere proclaime was madnesse:
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Neuer Hamlet.
If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away:
And when he's not himselfe, do's wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it:
Who does it then? His Madnesse? If't be so,
Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong'd,
His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy.
Sir, in this Audience,
Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd euill,
Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts,
That I haue shot mine Arrow o're the house,
And hurt my Mother.

+LAERTES
I am satisfied in Nature,
Whose motiue in this case should stirre me most
To my Reuenge. But in my termes of Honor
I stand aloofe, and will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor,
I haue a voyce, and president of peace
To keepe my name vngorg'd. But till that time,
I do receiue your offer'd loue like loue,
And wil not wrong it.

+HAMLET
I do embrace it freely,
And will this Brothers wager frankely play.
Giue vs the Foyles: Come on.

+LAERTES
Come one for me.

+HAMLET
Ile be your foile Laertes, in mine ignorance,
Your Skill shall like a Starre i'th'darkest night,
Sticke fiery off indeede.

+LAERTES
You mocke me Sir.

+HAMLET
No by this hand.

+KING
Giue them the Foyles yong Osricke,
Cousen Hamlet, you know the wager.

+HAMLET
Verie well my Lord,
Your Grace hath laide the oddes a'th'weaker side.

+KING
I do not feare it, / I haue seene you both:
But since he is better'd, we haue therefore oddes.

+LAERTES
This is too heauy, / Let me see another.

+HAMLET
This likes me well, / These Foyles haue all a length.

+OSR
I my good Lord.

SD: Prepare to play.

+KING
Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table:
If Hamlet giue the first, or second hit,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire,
The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath,
And in the Cup an vnion shal he throw
Richer then that, which foure successiue Kings
In Denmarkes Crowne haue worne. / Giue me the Cups,
And let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake,
The Trumpet to the Cannoneer without,
The Cannons to the Heauens, the Heauen to Earth,
Now the King drinkes to Hamlet. Come, begin,
And you the Iudges beare a wary eye.

+HAMLET
Come on sir.

+LAERTES
Come on sir.

SD: They play.

+HAMLET
One.

+LAERTES
No.

+HAMLET
Iudgement.

+OSR
A hit, a very palpable hit.

SD: Trumpets sound, and shot goes off.

+LAERTES
Well: againe.

+KING
Stay, giue me drinke. / Hamlet, this Pearle is thine,
Here's to thy health. Giue him the cup,

+HAMLET
Ile play this bout first, set by a-while.
Come:
Another hit; what say you?

+LAERTES
A touch, a touch, I do confesse.

+KING
Our Sonne shall win.

+QUEEN
He's fat, and scant of breath.
Heere's a Napkin, rub thy browes,
The Queene Carowses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

+HAMLET
Good Madam.

+KING
Gertrude, do not drinke.

+QUEEN
I will my Lord; / I pray you pardon me.

+KING
It is the poyson'd Cup, it is too late.

+HAMLET
I dare not drinke yet Madam, / By and by.

+QUEEN
Come, let me wipe thy face.

+LAERTES
My Lord, Ile hit him now.

+KING
I do not thinke't.

+LAERTES
And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.

+HAMLET
Come for the third. /Laertes, you but dally,
I pray you passe with your best violence,
I am affear'd you make a wanton of me.

+LAERTES
Say you so? Come on.

SD: Play.

+OSR
Nothing neither way.

+LAERTES
Haue at you now.

SD: In scuffling they change Rapiers.

+KING
Part them, they are incens'd.

+HAMLET
Nay come, againe.

+OSR
Looke to the Queene there hoa.

+HORATIO
They bleed on both sides. How is't my Lord?

+OSR
How is't Laertes?

+LAERTES
Why as a Woodcocke / To mine Sprindge, Osricke,
I am iustly kill'd with mine owne Treacherie.

+HAMLET
How does the Queene?

+KING
She sounds to see them bleede.

+QUEEN
No, no, the drinke, the drinke. / Oh my deere Hamlet,
the drinke, the drinke, / I am poyson'd.

+HAMLET
Oh Villany! How? Let the doore be lock'd.
Treacherie, seeke it out.

+LAERTES
It is heere Hamlet. / Hamlet, thou art slaine,
No Medicine in the world can do thee good.
In thee, there is not halfe an houre of life;
The Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand,
Vnbated and envenom'd: the foule practise
Hath turn'd it selfe on me. Loe, heere I lye,
Neuer to rise againe: Thy Mothers poyson'd:
I can no more, the King, the King's too blame.

+HAMLET
The point envenom'd too,
Then venome to thy worke.

+HAMLET, +HORATIO, +OSR, +LAERTES, +KING, +QUEEN
Treason, Treason.

+KING
O yet defend me Friends, I am but hurt.

+HAMLET
Heere thou incestuous, murdrous, / Damned Dane,
Drinke off this Potion:
Is thy Vnion heere?
Follow my Mother.

SD: +KING Dyes.

+LAERTES
He is iustly seru'd.
It is a poyson temp'red by himselfe:
Exchange forgiuenesse with me, Noble Hamlet;
Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee,
Nor thine on me.

SD: +LAERTES Dyes.

+HAMLET
Heauen make thee free of it, I follow thee.
I am dead Horatio, wretched Queene adiew,
You that looke pale, and tremble at this chance,
That are but Mutes or audience to this acte:
Had I but time (as this fell Sergeant death
Is strick'd in his Arrest) oh I could tell you.
But let it be: Horatio, I am dead,
Thou liu'st, report me and my causes right
To the vnsatisfied.

+HORATIO
Neuer beleeue it.
I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane:
Heere's yet some Liquor left.

+HAMLET
As th'art a man, giue me the Cup.
Let go, by Heauen Ile haue't.
Oh good Horatio, what a wounded name,
[Things standing thus vnknowne] shall liue behind me.
If thou did'st euer hold me in thy heart,
Absent thee from felicitie awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine,
To tell my Storie.

SD: March afarre off, and shout within. Enter +OSR.

+OSR
Yong Fortinbras, with conquest come frõ Poland
To th' Ambassadors of England giues
rhis warlike volly.

+HAMLET
O I dye Horatio:
The potent poyson quite ore-crowes my spirit,
I cannot liue to heare the Newes from England,
But I do prophesie th'election lights
On Fortinbras, he ha's my dying voyce,
So tell him with the occurrents more and lesse,
Which haue solicited. The rest is silence. O, o, o, o.

SD: +HAMLET Dyes

+HORATIO
Now cracke a Noble heart: / Goodnight sweet Prince,
And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest,
Why do's the Drumme come hither?

SD: Enter +FORTINBRAS and English Ambassador, with Drumme, Colours, and Attendants.

+FORTINBRAS
Where is this sight?

+HORATIO
What is it ye would see;
If ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search.

+FORTINBRAS
His quarry cries on hauocke. Oh proud death,
What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell.
That thou so many Princes, at a shoote,
So bloodily hast strooke.

+AMBASSADOR
The sight is dismall,
And our affaires from England come too late,
The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing,
To tell him his command'ment is fulfill'd,
That Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead:
Where should we haue our thankes?

+HORATIO
Not from his mouth,
Had it th'abilitie of life to thanke you:
He neuer gaue command'ment for their death.
But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question,
You from the Polake warres, and you from England
Are heere arriued. Giue order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view,
And let me speake to th'yet vnknowing world,
How these things came about. So shall you heare
Of carnall, bloudie, and vnnaturall acts,
Of accidentall iudgements, casuall slaughters
Of death's put on by cunning, and forc'd cause,
And in this vpshot, purposes mistooke,
Falne on the Inuentors heads. All this can I
Truly deliuer.

+FORTINBRAS
Let vs hast to heare it,
And call the Noblest to the Audience.
For me, with sorrow, I embrace my Fortune,
I haue some Rites of memory in this Kingdome,
Which are ro claime, my vantage doth / Inuite me,

+HORATIO
Of that I shall haue alwayes cause to speake,
And from his mouth / Whose voyce will draw on more:
But let this same be presently perform'd,
Euen whiles mens mindes are wilde, / Lest more mischance
On plots, and errors happen.

+FORTINBRAS
Let foure Captaines
Beare Hamlet like a Soldier to the Stage,
For he was likely, had he beene put on
To haue prou'd most royally: / And for his passage,
The Souldiours Musicke, and the rites of Warre
Speake lowdly for him.
Take vp the body; Such a sight as this
Becomes the Field, but heere shewes much amis.
Go, bid the Souldiers shoote.

SD: Exeunt +FORTINBRAS, +HORATIO, +OSR, +AMBASSADOR Marching: after the which, a Peale of Ordenance are shot off.
