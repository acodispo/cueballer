ACT 5
Act 5. Scene 1
Enter ROMEO and BENVOLIO
 
ROMEO
News from Verona!—How now?
Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?
How doth my Juliet? That I ask again,
For nothing can be ill if she be well.

BENVOLIO
Then she is well and nothing can be ill.
Her body sleeps in Capels’ monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

ROMEO
Is it e’en so?—Then I defy you, stars!—

BENVOLIO
I do beseech you, have patience.

ROMEO  
Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?

BENVOLIO
No.

ROMEO  
No matter. Get thee gone,							[Exit BENVOLIO]
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.
I do remember an apothecary
(And hereabouts he dwells) 
An if a man did need a poison now,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
What ho, Apothecary!
 
Enter APOTHECARY
 
APOTHECARY
Who calls so loud?

ROMEO
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
A dram of poison.

APOTHECARY
Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law
Is death to any he that utters them.

ROMEO
The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law.
The world affords no law to make thee rich.
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

APOTHECARY
My poverty, but not my will, consents.

ROMEO
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

APOTHECARY
Put this in any liquid thing you will
And drink it off, and if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

ROMEO
There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,				[Exit APOTHECARY]
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.

Exit ROMEO
 
Act 5. Scene 2
Enter FRIAR JOHN
 
FRIAR JOHN
Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
 
Enter FRIAR LAWRENCE
 
FRIAR LAWRENCE
Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

FRIAR JOHN
The searchers of the town,
Suspecting that I was in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Sealed up the doors and would not let me forth,
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed.

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

FRIAR JOHN
I could not send it—here it is again—

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice but full of charge,
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence.				[Exit FRIAR JOHN]
Now must I to the monument alone.
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents.
But I will write again to Mantua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man’s tomb!

Exit FRIAR LAWRENCE
 
Act 5. Scene 3
Enter PARIS
 
PARIS
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
What cursèd foot wanders this way tonight,
To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
Muffle me, night, awhile.

PARIS hides
Enter ROMEO and BENVOLIO
 
ROMEO
Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Hence, begone.

Exit BENVOLIO

PARIS
This is that banished haughty Montague
That murdered my love’s cousin
Condemnèd villain, I do apprehend thee.
Obey and go with me, for thou must die.

ROMEO
Tempt not a desp’rate man.

PARIS
I do apprehend thee for a felon here.

ROMEO
Wilt thou provoke me?

ROMEO and PARIS fight. ROMEO wounds PARIS

PARIS
O, I am slain!

Exit PARIS

ROMEO
Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!
Here lies Juliet. O my love, my wife,
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Tybalt, what more favor can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin.—Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? Here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh! Eyes, look your last.
Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O, you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.				[ROMEO kisses JULIET]
Here’s to my love. O true apothecary,
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

ROMEO dies

JULIET
Where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
What’s here? A cup closed in my true love’s hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.—
O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after! I will kiss thy lips.
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make me die with a restorative.                              		[JULIET kisses ROMEO]
Thy lips are warm!
Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O, happy dagger,
This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die.

JULIET stabs herself
Enter PRINCE
 
PRINCE
What misadventure is so early up
That calls our person from our morning rest?
 
Enter CAPULET
 
CAPULET
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad?
O heavens! Look how my daughter bleeds!
O me, this sight of death is as a bell
That warns my old age to a sepulcher.
 
Enter MONTAGUE
 
PRINCE
Come, Montague, for thou art early up
To see thy son and heir now early down.

MONTAGUE
What further woe conspires against mine age?

PRINCE
Look, and thou shalt see.

MONTAGUE
O thou untaught! What manners is in this,
To press before thy father to a grave?

PRINCE
Seal up the mouth of outrage for awhile,
Till we can clear these ambiguities
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

Enter FRIAR LAWRENCE and BENVOLIO

FRIAR LAWRENCE
I am the greatest, able to do least,

PRINCE
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

FRIAR LAWRENCE
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,
I married them, and their stol’n marriage day
Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death
Banished the new-made bridegroom from this city,
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betrothed and would have married her perforce
To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
A sleeping potion, which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stayed by accident,
At her awakening, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
And she, too desperate, it seems, did violence on herself.

PRINCE
We still have known thee for a holy man.—
Where’s Romeo’s cousin? What can he say to this?

BENVOLIO
I brought my cousin news of Juliet’s death,
This letter he early bid me give his father.

PRINCE
This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies?—Capulet, Montague,
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love,
And I, for winking at your discords too,
Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.

CAPULET
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE
But I can give thee more,
For I will ray her statue in pure gold,
That whiles Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.

CAPULET
As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,
Poor sacrifices of our enmity.

PRINCE
A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
Go hence to have more talk of these sad things.
Some shall be pardoned, and some punishèd.
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

Exit ALL
