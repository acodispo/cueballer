NS: Act 2 Scene 2

SD: Enter LADY MACBETH.

LADY MACBETH
That which hath made them drunk, hath made me bold:
What hath quench'd them, hath giuen me fire. 
Hearke, peace: it was the Owle that shriek'd,
The fatall Bell-man, which giues the stern'st good-night.
He is about it, the Doores are open: 
And the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge 
With Snores. I haue drugg'd their Possets,
That Death and Nature doe contend about them,
Whether they liue, or dye.

MACBETH
Who's there? what hoa?
