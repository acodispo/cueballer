ACT I. SCENE I


     SCENE a Tavern.




     _Colonel_ Fainwell _and_ Freeman _over a Bottle_.


_Freeman._ Come, Colonel, his Majesty's Health.--You are as
melancholy as if you were in Love: I wish some of the Beauties of
_Bath_ han't snapt your Heart.


_Col._ Why, Faith, _Freeman_, there is something in't: I have
seen a Lady at _Bath_, who has kindled such a Flame in me that all
the Waters there can't quench.


_Free._ Women, like some poisonous Animals, carry their Antidote
about 'em--Is she not to be had, Colonel?


_Col._ That's a difficult Question to answer; however, I resolve
to try: Perhaps you may be able to serve me; you Merchants know one
another.--The Lady told me herself, she was under the Charge of four
Persons.


_Free._ Odso! 'tis Mrs. _Ann Lovely_.


_Col._ The same.--Do you know her?


_Free._ Know her! Ay.--Faith, Colonel, your Condition is more
desperate than you imagine: Why, she is the Talk and Pity of the whole
Town; and it is the Opinion of the Learned, that she must die a Maid.


_Col._ Say you so? That's somewhat odd, in this charitable
City.--She's a Woman, I hope.


_Free._ For aught I know,--but it had been as well for her, had
Nature made her any other Part of the Creation. The Man who keeps this
House, serv'd her Father; he is a very honest Fellow, and may be of Use
to you; we'll send for him to take a Glass with us; he'll give you her
whole History, and 'tis worth your hearing.


_Col._ But may one trust him?


_Free._ With your Life: I have Obligations enough upon him to make
him do any thing: I serve him with Wine. [_Knocks._


_Col._ Nay, I know him pretty well myself. I once used to frequent
a Club that was kept here.


     _Enter Drawer._


_Draw._ Gentlemen, d'ye call?


_Free._ Ay; send up your Master.


_Draw._ Yes, Sir. [_Exit._


_Col._ Do you know any of this Lady's Guardians, _Freeman_?


_Free._ Yes, I know two of them very well.


     _Enter_ Sackbut.


_Free._ Here comes one will give you an Account of them all--Mr.
_Sackbut_, we sent for you to take a Glass with us. 'Tis a Maxim
among the Friends of the Bottle, that as long as the Master is in
Company, one may be sure of good Wine.


_Sack._ Sir, you shall be sure to have as good Wine as you send
in--Colonel, your most humble Servant; you are welcome to Town.


_Col._ I thank you, Mr. _Sackbut_.


_Sack._ I am as glad to see you, as I should a hundred Tun of _French_
Claret Custom-free--My Service to you, Sir, (_drinks_) You don't look
so merry as you used to do; ar'n't you well, Colonel?


_Free._ He has got a Woman in his Head, Landlord, can you help him?


_Sack._ If 'tis in my Power, I shan't scruple to serve my Friend.


_Col._ 'Tis one Perquisite of your Calling.


_Sack._ Ay, at 'tother End of the Town, where you Officers use,
Women are good Forcers of Trade: A well-accustom'd House, a handsome
Bar-keeper, with clean obliging Drawers, soon get the Master an Estate;
but our Citizens do seldom any thing but cheat within the Walls.--But
as to the Lady, Colonel, point you at Particulars, or have you a good
_Champagne_ Stomach? Are you in full Pay, or reduc'd, Colonel?


_Col._ Reduc'd, reduc'd, Landlord.


_Free._ To the miserable Condition of a Lover!


_Sack._ Pish! that's preferable to Half-pay; a Woman's Resolution
may break before the Peace; push her home, Colonel, there's no parlying
with the fair Sex.


_Col._ Were the Lady her own Mistress, I have some Reasons to
believe I should command in Chief.


_Free._ You know Mrs. _Lovely_, Mr. _Sackbut_?


_Sack._ Know her! Ay, poor _Nancy_; I have carried her to School many
a frosty Morning. Alas! if she's the Woman, I pity you, Colonel:
Her Father, my old Master, was the most whimsical, out-of-the-Way
temper'd Man I ever heard of, as you will guess by his last Will and
Testament--This was his only Child: I have heard him wish her dead a
thousand Times.


_Col._ Why so?


_Sack._ He hated Posterity, you must know, and wish'd the World
were to expire with himself--He used to swear, if she had been a Boy,
he would have qualified him for the Opera.


_Free._ 'Tis a very unnatural Resolution in a Father.


_Sack._ He died worth thirty thousand Pounds, which he left to
his Daughter, provided she married with the Consent of her Guardians:
But that she might be sure never to do so, he left her in the Care of
four Men, as opposite to each other as the four Elements; each has his
quarterly Rule, and three Months in a Year she is obliged to be subject
to each of their Humours, and they are pretty different, I assure
you--She is just come from _Bath_.


_Col._ 'Twas there I saw her.


_Sack._ Ay, Sir, the last Quarter was her Beau Guardian's--She
appears in all publick Places during his Reign.


_Col._ She visited a Lady who boarded in the same house with
me: I lik'd her Person, and found an Opportunity to tell her so. She
reply'd, she had no Objection to mine; but if I could not reconcile
Contradictions I must not think of her, for that she was condemned to
the Caprice of four Persons, who never yet agreed in any one Thing, and
she was oblig'd to please them all.


_Sack._ 'Tis most true, Sir; I'll give you a short Description of
the Men, and leave you to judge of the poor Lady's Condition. One is a
Kind of Virtuoso, a silly half-witted Fellow, but positive and surly,
fond of every thing antique and foreign, and wears his Cloaths of the
Fashion of the last Century; doats upon Travellers, and believes more
of Sir _John Mandeville_ than he does of the Bible.


_Col._ That must be a rare odd Fellow!


_Sack._ Another is a Change-Broker; a Fellow that will out-lie the
Devil for the Advantage of Stock, and cheat his Father that got him, in
a Bargain: He is a great Stickler for Trade, and hates every Man that
wears a Sword.--


_Free._ He is a great Admirer of the _Dutch_ Management, and
swears they understand Trade better than any Nation under the Sun.--


_Sack._ The Third is an old Beau, that has _May_ in his Fancy and
Dress, but _December_ in his Face and his Heels: He admires all the new
Fashions, and those must be _French_; loves Operas, Balls, Masquerades,
and is always the most tawdry of the whole Company on a Birth-Day.


_Col._ These are pretty opposite to one another, truly! and the
Fourth, What is he, Landlord?


_Sack._ A very rigid Quaker, whose Quarter begun this Day.--I saw
Mrs. _Lovely_ go in, not above two Hours ago,--Sir _Philip_
set her down. What think you now, Colonel, is not the poor Lady to be
pitied?


_Col._ Ay, and rescu'd too, Landlord.


_Free._ In my Opinion, that's impossible.


_Col._ There is nothing impossible to a Lover. What would not a
Man attempt for a fine Woman and thirty thousand Pounds? Besides, my
Honour is at Stake; I promised to deliver her,--and she bid me win her
and wear her.


_Sack._ That's fair, Faith.


_Free._ If it depended upon Knight-errantry, I should not doubt
your setting free the Damsel; but to have Avarice, Impertinence,
Hypocrisy, and Pride, at once to deal with, requires more Cunning, than
generally attends a Man of Honour.


_Col._ My Fancy tells me, I shall come off with Glory, I resolve
to try however.--Do you know all the Guardians, Mr. _Sackbut_?


_Sack._ Very well, Sir, they all use my House.


_Col._ And will you assist me, if Occasion requires?


_Sack._ In every thing I can, Colonel.


_Free._ I'll answer for him; and whatever I can serve you in,
you may depend on. I know Mr. _Periwinkle_ and Mr. _Tradelove_;
the latter, has a very great Opinion of my Interest abroad--I happen'd
to have a Letter from a Correspondent two Hours before the News
arrived of the _French_ King's Death: I communicated it to him; upon
which he bought up all the Stock he could, and what with that, and
some Wagers he laid, he told me he had got to the Tune of five hundred
Pounds; so that I am much in his good Graces.


_Col._ I don't know but you may be of Service to me,
_Freeman_.


_Free._ If I can, command me, Colonel.


_Col._ Isn't it possible to find a Suit of Cloaths ready made
at some of these Sale-shops fit to rig out a Beau, think you, Mr.
_Sackbut_?


_Sack._ O hang'em--No Colonel, they keep nothing ready made that a
Gentleman would be seen in: But I can fit you with a Suit of Cloaths,
if you'd make a Figure--Velvet and Gold Brocade--They were pawn'd to me
by a _French_ Count, who had been stript at Play, and wanted Money
to carry him Home; he promised to send for them, but I have not heard
any Thing of him.


_Free._ He has not fed upon Frogs long enough yet to recover his
Loss; ha, ha!


_Col._ Ha, ha! Well, the Cloaths will do, Mr.
_Sackbut_,--tho' we must have three or four Fellows in tawdry
Liveries: They can be procur'd, I hope.


_Free._ Egad! I have a Brother come from the _West Indies_
that can match you; and, for Expedition-sake, you shall have his
Servants: There's a Black, a Tawnymoor, and a _Frenchman_; they
don't speak one Word of _English_, so can make no Mistake.


_Col._ Excellent!--Egad! I shall look like an _Indian_
Prince. First I'll attack my Beau Guardian; where lives he?


_Sack._ Faith, somewhere about St. _James's_; tho' to say
in what Street, I cannot; but any Chairman will tell you where Sir
_Philip Modelove_ lives.


_Free._ Oh! you'll find him in the Park at Eleven every Day; at
least, I never pass'd thro' at that Hour without seeing him there--But
what do you intend?


_Col._ To address him in his own Way, and find what he designs to
do with the Lady.


_Free._ And what then?


_Col._ Nay, that I cannot tell; but I shall take my Measures
accordingly.


_Sack._ Well, 'tis a mad Undertaking, in my Mind: But here's to
your Success, Colonel. (_Drinks._)


_Col._ 'Tis something out of the Way, I confess; but Fortune
may chance to smile, and I succeed. Come, Landlord, let me see those
Cloaths. _Freeman_, I shall expect you'll leave Word with Mr.
_Sackbut_, where one may find you upon Occasion; and send me the
_Indian_ Equipage immediately, d'ye hear?


_Free._ Immediately. [_Exit._


_Col._


  _Bold was the Man who ventur'd first to Sea,_
  _But the first vent'ring Lovers bolder were._

  _And he that runs the Risque deserves the Fair._  [Exit.
